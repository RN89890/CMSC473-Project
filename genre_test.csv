Yeah...!
In a world of hate pollution 
We can't breathe anymore. 

We've to leave and this time you,

The pawn, have won. 

On our quest for nowhere island

We set off to the sea. 

You call surrender what we call a calm

Before the storm... 



[Bridge]

Pounding thoughts of home

They make me know... I will return!

I don't live my life for you

It's too short to get burned.

Stand upright and face the wind...



[Chorus]

Time to go

Back where I belong...

No one can prevent me from

Raising towers in Babylon.

Time to go

Back where I belong...

No one can accuse me

For I do not fear Babylon!

Babylon...!



You only can love me if you can convert me 

To attitudes of your brain. 

You blame us for doing things

That you don't know

You tell me what you'd do

If you were me, but you are you and I am I 

Lucky you, but this time I say: ""No!"" 



[Bridge]

Pounding thoughts of home

They make me know... I will return!

I don't want to hurt you

But you will have to learn... 

You are you and I am I!

"Never ever, felt this way about... 
The things you do to me 
Never ever knew, couldn't do without 
You and me 
But I didn't read between your lines 

And I didn't know there was no one like you to find 



Why didn't I see 

This before 



Why didn't I come 

Back for more 



Now I do feel 

The pain inside 



Now I have seen 

All I can do is hide and.. 



Cry... 

All I can do is 

Cry 



Cry... 

All I can do is 

Cry 

Like this 



Cry... 

All I can do is 

Cry 

Like this 



Maybe one day I will realize 

That you're gone 



Maybe now I can't see the world apply 

Has become 



The beginning of a 

Lonely night 



The beginning of a love 

'Cause these words linger in my mind 



Why didn't I see 

This before 



Why didnt I come 

Back for more 



Now, I do feel 

The pain inside 



Now, I have seen 

All I can do is hide and.. 



Cry... 

All I can do is

"Got a surprise especially for you,
Something that both of us have always wanted to do.
We've waited so long, waited so long.
We've waited so long, waited so long.
I'm gonna take you on a trip so far from here,

I've got two tickets in my pocket, now baby, we're gonna disappear.

We've waited so long, waited so long.

We've waited so long, waited so long.



I've got two tickets to paradise,

Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight,

I've got two tickets to paradise,

"Stabbed in the heart, life's falling apart
Never look back, but I don't want to
Your selfish ways will catch up one day


Never look back







I guess we just went downhill



A shame, but life is cruel



Should have known, we became so silent



I didn't ask, but I wanted to







The connection, barely worth it



I'm confused, and honestly dry



Now I'm asking master questions



It seemed natural at the time







Now my bed is free



Crushed pillows, rolled back sheets



Now the mess is mine



I can do whatever I like







We're banging our heads together



Crossed wires, we do intrude



My hopes and wishes are blasted



You dumb girl, it was never you







I guess we just went downhill



Aware of the fact we clash



No love is ever perfect



We made the effort, and now it's passed",Electronic
"I'm moving to Tokyo
Cuz I'm tired of San Francisco
My contracts are finally void
And I am getting out
On houses and building tops
I swallow the beams and sundrops

If my echos could reach your ears

Then I could save my calls

What happens when I'm above

The east river when you are in love

We're staring at all these lights

And I am going blind



Fill all of the navy yards

With hard working security guards

Cuz the numbers are wearing off

My plastic access cards

How can I begin to say

I feel better off when we stay

In Paris on winter nights

Beneath the snowy veil

Content like a panda bear

Still breathing the fresh mountain air

I'll put on a diving tank

And sing when I inhale",Pop
"You could have been all I wanted,
But you weren't honest,
Now get in the ground,
You choked off the surest of favors,
But if you really loved me,
You would have endured my reign...



Well if you're just, as I presumed,

A whore in sheep's clothing,

Fucking up all I do...



And if so here we stop,

Then never, again will you see,

This in your life...



Hang on to the glory at my right hand,

Here lay to rest is a love ever long,

With truth on the shores of confession,

You seem to take premise, to all of these souls...



You stormed off to scar the armada,

Like Jesus played letter,

I'll drill through your hands,

The stone for the curse you have blamed me...



With love and devotion I'll die as you sleep,

But you could just rat me out,

To never mis-warn her happy will I become,

Be true that this is no option,

So rinse it, condemn you demon raiding in love...



Hang on to the glory at my right hand,

Here lay to rest is a love ever long,

With truth on the shores of confession,

You seem to take premise to all of these songs...



One last kiss for you,

One more wish till you,

Please make up your mind girl,

I'd do anything for you,

One last kiss for you,

One more wish till you,

Please make up your mind girl,

Before I hope you die...

"We stay, moving around, so low
Ask us where you went, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
You got your bus and got gone
And left us all alone

Now she in the club with a freaky dress on

cats don't want her to keep that dress on

Tryin to get enough drinks in her system

Take it to the tele and make her a victim



Controlling the brain, ball play you in the face

They shake the spot, she's just another case



Easy for a good girl to gone bad

And once we've gone (gone)

There's belief we've gone forever

Don't be the reason

Don't be the reason

You better learn how to treat us right

Cause onces a good girl goes bad

We die forever



He's staying with a flock of them oh, yeah

Got a girl at home but he don't care

Won't care (won't care)

All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go no-where

He thinks because I'm at home I won't be gettin it on

And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets

Chicks calling the house, no stop its

Getting out of control

finally I can't take no more

Because I met her on the stairs, saying this is the end

I packed my bag and left with your best friend



Easy for a good girl to gone bad

And once we've gone (gone)

There's belief we've gone forever

Don't be the reason

"Oh, it's carnival night
And they're stringing the lights around you
Hanging paper angels
Painting little devils on the roof
Oh the furnace wind

Is a flickering of wings about your face

In a cloud of incense

Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place



I can't eat, can't sleep

Still I hunger for you when you look at me

That face, those eyes

All the sinful pleasures deep inside



Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in

Underneath my skin, 

Oh you were always my original sin

And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin 

This dangerous game

Oh you were always my original sin



A dream will fly

A dream is just a riddle

"It's coming through a hole in the air, 
from those nights in Tiananmen Square. 
It's coming from the feel 
that this ain't exactly real, 
or it's real, but it ain't exactly there. 
From the wars against disorder, 

from the sirens night and day, 

from the fires of the homeless, 

from the ashes of the gay: 

Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

It's coming through a crack in the wall; 

on a visionary flood of alcohol; 

from the staggering account 

of the Sermon on the Mount 

which I don't pretend to understand at all. 

It's coming from the silence 

on the dock of the bay, 

from the brave, the bold, the battered 

heart of Chevrolet: 

Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 



It's coming from the sorrow in the street, 

the holy places where the races meet; 

from the homicidal bitchin' 

that goes down in every kitchen 

to determine who will serve and who will eat. 

From the wells of disappointment 

where the women kneel to pray 

for the grace of God in the desert here 

and the desert far away: 

Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 



Sail on, sail on 

O mighty Ship of State! 

To the Shores of Need 

Past the Reefs of Greed 

Through the Squalls of Hate 

Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on. 



It's coming to America first, 

the cradle of the best and of the worst. 

It's here they got the range 

and the machinery for change 

and it's here they got the spiritual thirst. 

It's here the family's broken 

and it's here the lonely say 

that the heart has got to open 

in a fundamental way: 

Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 



It's coming from the women and the men. 

O baby, we'll be making love again. 

We'll be going down so deep 

the river's going to weep, 

and the mountain's going to shout Amen! 

It's coming like the tidal flood 

beneath the lunar sway, 

imperial, mysterious, 

in amorous array: 

Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 



Sail on, sail on ... 



I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean 

I love the country but I can't stand the scene. 

And I'm neither left or right 

I'm just staying home tonight, 

getting lost in that hopeless little screen. 

But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags 

that Time cannot decay, 

I'm junk but I'm still holding up 

this little wild bouquet: 

Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.",Rock
"When the lights went off in Hogtown
The strippers closed their eyes
The arcade quarters dropped 
Like boiler room flies
The high beams and high rollers
Fishtail through the night

When the lights went off in Hogtown

Oh, let the good times roll

From Honest Ed's

Down to Cherry Road



The alley cats in Cabbagetown

Are licking at their wounds

And knocking over garbage cans

With rodents and raccoons

Diplomatico's a stillframe

Oh, let the good times roll

For a life, yes a life, I thought I knew
Oh, it's the price we gotta pay and all the games we gotta play

Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on

'Cause it's a game we gotta lose, though it's a life we gotta choose

And the price is our own life until it's done



Time seems to have frozen but the mind can be fooled

As the days pass I discover, destiny just can't be ruled

For the prize, yes the prize, I thought I knew



Oh, it's the price we gotta pay and all the games we gotta play

"Angry youth
MR. Elite
Your older now
Inside your head lives an old scene
MR. Punk
Sad and hating everyone

Your excuse is old

The way you felt has left you hating yourself

Cause everyone is so confused

You never worked for a cent

Self-destructive you pay your debt

Cause you miss another time

when all your friends were divine

Now all of them have gone or changed

Do you still live in angry days?

But when you've lost someone you love

When your mask is taken off

Does life cut you down to size?

Does it open up your eyes?

Beacuse they all have found their way

as you struggle through your maze

You built those walls of hate

Don't tell me it's too late",Punk
"Lies.
Under the eyes of suspicion.
A time and place to cause destruction.
Losing respect from the nations.
Our own allies disapproval.
Fuel the fire.

Our own fathers shelter lies.

Fuel the fire.

Abusive power crushing lives.

Fuel the fire.

Our innonence betrayed.

Bow to the pressus of ability.

Led times of anger to the grave.

Show times of prosper.

But who is saved?

Under the hand of damnation.

Many have lost faith.

Lost all respect from the nations.

Our own allies disapproval.

Fire has gone on too long.

Shadows are cast from our rule.

Fire has gone on too long.

Shadows are cast - Now end the lies.

Forced on me the casualties.

Never will I believe.

Kneel along the protective wrong.

Never will I velieve.

Never will I believe in your destructive wrong.

From the disgusting harm that cause so many to bleed

and leave us with questioning ears.

False informing our belief is searer.

You could take me in fours

Take it off, just stay a week

Basic space, open air

Don't look away, when there's nothing there 



I'm setting us in stone 

Piece by piece before I'm alone 

Air tight, before we break

Keep it in, keep us safe

I'm getting in, let it set

Got to seal this in, can't adjust 

Can't relearn got to keep what I have

Its so unfair but so clear
Don't none of them represent me
And aint one of them represent my peers
And it don't matter who we vote for, nor who gets in

Mothers keep losing their children to the system

They stay strong while we remain victims

Telling us to hope for higher things

Educate yourself aint that how ya'll say it

But they keep increasing the fee

Knowing full well that we cant pay it

And did you stop and listen before you started dishing

Our tax for ammunition to kill innocent children

When right in front of you we cant cope

We hungry, homeless, unemployed and broke

Were dying, the health service is a joke

You said things would change when you wanted our votes

But yet who's gonna protect me from the beasts

They aint got my interest at heart

They aint my friends

So much corruption and this gun shit wont end

And all they sit and f***ing do is blame 50 Cent

Please, now take responsibility

Who's putting them runs on our streets

And who's pumping drugs into our community

Controlling the propaganda on my T.V.

And who's molding our children's ideologies

And taking away their opportunity

Were killing each other so we can live above our means

Cause what we earn cant even buy a fraction of our dreams

And wonder why so many have become fiends

Its so hard to live poor and keep your hands clean

So I am keeping mind together

And pray that god forgives my sins

Its real hard living the life were living

I'm overwhelmed with anxiety
It's taking over me
Can't calm my nerves

There is no doubt I need some help

How can I learn to protect me from myself?

Restraint is on the shelf

I just can't be alone with myself too long

Can't stop my trembling hands

I've got the shakes again

Convinced myself the needle's

Never been so high

I'm sure if I wanted I could touch the sky

I'm already halfway there

But I'm falling down

Seems my time to fly is running out

Does anybody really care?



I've figured it out

There is no doubt I need some help

Can you try to save me from myself?



This craving is too strong

I've lost all self control

I just can't be alone

With myself anymore

I've nothing left to lose

And nothing stops the pain

But the poison

That I pump through my veins



And my tears they leave a stain

And my heart won't beat the strain

Cause the beast I just can't tame



I've figured it out

There is no doubt I need some help

Can I ever really trust myself?

The digger in the hole,

Or the rush of the crushing street,

On the plain, on the foamy main,

You can never escape from the beat.

It's in the mud and it's in your blood

And its conquest is complete.

And all that you can do is just surrender.



To the Majesty of Rock!

The Pageantry of Roll!

The crowing of the cock,

The running of the foal!

The shepherd with his flock,

The miner with his coal,

We're in this together...and ever...



When we die, do we haunt the sky?

Do we lurk in the murk of the seas?

What then? Are we born again?

Just to sit asking questions like these?

I know, for I told me so,

And I'm sure each of you quite agrees:

The more it stays the same, the less it changes!



And that's The Majesty Of Rock!

The Mystery of Roll!

The darning of the sock,

The scoring of the goal!

The barber takes a pole.

Yesterday I had it all worked out to a 'T'
But now something's wrong between you and me
I was wrong, so wrong
To think that I would stay
Seasons come and seasons go

And today is another day



I wanna say now's the time

To go our separate ways

I don't know I might be wrong

Could we find the strength to say

That our love, our love's seen some better days

And who's to say if I had the chance

That I'd make the choice to say

If you ever had something that you wanted to say

You better start talking before I go away

I wish that I could say I've been feeling okay

That I'll be bringing on the better days

Freedom never cries

To settle my soul

A song for a dead man

And now I'll never grow old

I wrote a song for a dead man

Now I'm hollowed in the cold

What's a song to a dead man to me?

Die for her

Lay down your life for her

Kiss and wave goodbye to her

Anything at all

You can cry for her

Die for her

Make up your mind to her

Anything at all



There's a baby on the doorstep

Wailing away

There's a baby on the doorstep

Longing for the day

There's a baby on the doorstep

Who'd give his life to take

A flag to a pawn shop

May he forget why he is crying

Oh your kisses placed so gently over every sentence formed oh it felt so warm

"Emotions inside us troubling,
The hatred inside us escalating,
The sickness inside us keeps us weak,
The masses inside of us suffering they are bleeding,
The calling inside us sick with greed,
The voices calling to us deafening we're not listening 



Cannot receive the obvious 

Line up cattle and cut the necks 

Swat at the flies omit disgust 



The leaders inside us posturing,

The pollution inside of us suffocating me,

The science inside us menacing 

The will that's inside of us its dying end is coming 



Cannot receive the obvious 

Line up cattle and cut the necks 

Drain us of life and cleanse the mess 



Wash me off inside, wash me off inside 



We're killing ourselves killers 

Goddamn we fucked up the circumstance,

Too late to save us from ourselves,

Callous minds against trust and confidence,

Too late to give a damn now 

Too late to save us from ourselves, too late to make it all go away,

Too late to beg pardons from the mother, too late to give a damn 



Now we'll sit and wait 



Wait wait for the coming. of the end 

Wait for the coming the killing the ending the plight of man 

Deserving no mercy expelling by god's hand,

It's okay the ending it's over no more pain .

"Today's not the same 
as every day 
it's far from ordinary 
The pain I endure 
You're my cure 
but my mistakes have led me 

far away from you... 





You turn away 

from all those things 

that I've been trying to say 

and all those promises 

I shouldn't have made 

I did it for you 





My open mind 

feelings I just can't reconcile 

my heart's on a string 

these broken wings 

you knew I'd be so fragile 

Far away from you... 





You turn away 

from all those things 

that I've been trying to say 

and all those promises 

I shouldn't have made 

I did it for you 



I searched my soul 

and all these feelings 

that I can't control 

and you're the one thing 

that can make me whole 

I did it for you 





Try to let you know 

Try to let you know 

Try to let you know... 





Today is not the same 

as everyday 

it's far from ordinary... 





You turn away 

from all those things 

that I've been trying to say 

and all those promises 

I shouldn't have made 

I did it for you 



Oh I searched my soul 

and all these feelings 

that I can't control 

and you're the one thing 

that can make me whole 

I did it for you... 

I did it for you... 

I did it for you... 



You're the one thing that can make me whole

"Wash with new soap behind the collar
keeps a clean mental state
don't usually bother in cold weather
but still i'm getting into work late
and i don't need the practise
i've been making plans (for the future)

become an unconcious man (all for the good)

feel so unecessary (we don't think so, you seem starshaped)

i have a couple at the weekend

helps keep up comaraderie

and my mind boggles in the muddle

at the possibilities

wash with new soap behind the collar

helps keep down the laundry

because it cleans me mentally",Rock
"Verse 1
The last that ever she saw him, carried away by a moonlight shadown,
He passed on worried and warning, carried away by a moonlight shadown,
Lost in the riddle last Saturday night, far away on the other side,
he was caught in the middle of a desperate fight, and she couldn't find how to push through.



Verse 2



The trees that whisper in the evening, carried away by a moonlight shadown,

Sing the song of sorrow and grieving, carried away by a moonlight shadown,

All she saw was a silhouette of a gun, far away on the other side,

He was shot six times by a man on the run, and she couldn't find how to push through.



Verse 3



Four a.m. in the morning, carried away by a moonlight shadown,

I watched your vision forming, carried away by a moonlight shadown,

Star was glowin' in a silvery night, far away on the other side,

Will you come to talk to me this night, but she couldn't find how to push through.

Alligator green, salamander sticky

She tried to plant a hickie on Pretty Tony

Only if she knew the repercussions

I tried to lend her some enlighenment (but)

She was frightened by it

More inspired by desire and Myer's rum (hmm)

Firewater consumption got her mind numb

Still goin in circles, it's a miracle

To some others it's a shame why they suffocate to strain

Seeking comfort in this painful retreat
Made an oracle against my will

Word spread of miraculous skills

Now I embrace it and I'll never be the same



Transfixed in the desert sands

Take a look at my once empty hand

See the rose that appears so real

Just like the one you saw in your dreams

Know not what they're looking for

They just feed their flames with miracles

Just so you know

If you bathe within my light

You diminish your own might

"Trying to tell you what you can or can't do
Why should anyone know better
You know you must find your own way to go
No-one else there to pave it
Trying to please and just keep of harm's way
You won't ever make the distance

Across the storms on life's sea

If you don't lift your sails



Need no hindsight

Need no magic

Need no preachers in your way



Get your mind together

Keep it strong

Don't lost your face

Be a rider of storm

Whatever lies ahead

Just bring it on

Bold and untamed

Be a rider of storm



Keep an eye on the winds of luck turning

One day they'll be blowing your way

Knocked down, don't turn the other cheek

Find a way to get even



They try to keep you down every way they can

Give 'em hell until they push you no more

Go ride the storm

"(This is a song about sevear emotional problems)
I always believed that if I ran off to India
Wore sandals and shaved my head


And used Body shop conditioner, and incense like crazy



I could call myself a spirit head



But I only went to India to look on top



I wore sandals cause I'd smoked all my money



And I shaved off all my hair cause I had the fleas



I'd been sleeping all over



And the Body shop conditioner was a present from a friend



And the incense used to hide the smell



Of the drug den that I lay in







And so I ask myself what my motives are



For this lying need to look so free



And if I tell myself real honestly



What more can I admit to, open up a door



He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for



He said I'd find out soon



I got too much Saturn and not enough Moon











I always believed that if I never missed a Yoga class



Read my horoscope in the dailies



And recycle bottles, and know a Red Indian



I could call myself a spirit man



But I was only doing Yoga cause I fancied the teacher



And stars cause it looked good on paper



And I only went to church cause my granny gave me money



When confession was over



And I only knew the Indian cause his brother's a dealer



And bottles had a price on their return



So I could go and play, Oh my my











And so I ask myself what my motives are



For this lying need to look so free



And if I tell myself real honestly



What more can I admit to, open up a door



He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for



He said I'd find out soon



I got too much Saturn and not enough Moon











So now that you know why I don't love you



And now that you see that I'm so scared



Am I a good man ?



Am I a deep deep man ?











What more can I admit to, open up a door



He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for



He said I'd find out soon



I got too much Saturn



How can I admit it, open up a door



He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for



He said I'd find out soon



I got too much Saturn and not enough Moon",Rock

It shakes me cold
In the morning when you're feeling low
You're worth your weight in gold

No heart, no soul

I'm sinking deep, I need to feel that glow

You're worth your weight in gold

I need to feel you

I need to feel right through you

Everything here is a closed door

"Intro: Sido als Frank Furz 
Hallo, Ich bin's wieder! 
Frank Furz vom Schulradio Schlaue Welle 
des Mittelfinger Gymnasiums am Karl-Marx-Platz! 
Heute gibt's in der Mensa Kartoffeln mit Speck! 

Unser Direktor ist krank! 

Und wir haben ein Interviewpartner hier im Studio! 

Stell dich mal vor, falls die Leute dich nicht kennen! 



Die Strophe: Sido (Sido als Frank Furz) 



Yeah, gib mir das Mikro! Man nennt mich Sido! 

Ich bin 1,86 und wieg 72 Kilo! 

Ich trag 'ne Brille und rasier mich nicht oft! 

Ich wohn noch in nem Loch, doch bald in nem Loft! (Yeah) 

(Wo kommst du her?) 

Ich bin aus Westberlin! Ich musste letztens aus'm Wedding in's MV zieh'n! 

(Ist das das Ghetto von dem du immer sprichst?) 

Ja genau! Auch wenn ihr denkt, dass es keins ist! 

Ich seh's jeden Tag, Ich weiss was hier abgeht! 

Wenn jemand ablebt, weil einer am Rad dreht! 

(Wie lange rappst du?) 

Ich rap seitdem Ich denke! 

Es hört nicht auf, irgendwann rappen meine Enkel! 

(Wer schreibt deine Texte?) 

Meine Texte schreibt das Leben! 

Ich brauch nicht mehr zu tun als'n Stift zur Hand zu nehmen! 

(Hast du was gelernt?) 

He, nein! Ich kann nur rappen! 

Achso, ja doch, ich kann feiern auf Tabletten! 

(Nimmst du viele Drogen?) 

Ja doch, so ziemlich alles! 

Im Sommer nicht soviel, wie wenn's im Winter kalt ist! 

(Echt? Verrückt! Was is' mit deiner Gesundheit?) 

Ich sorg einfach dafür, dass die Welt immer bunt bleibt! 

(Ich hab gehört Aggro Berlin hat dich gesignt?) 

He, ja! Um mich zu kriegen haben die voll rumgeschleimt! 

Eine Million Vorschuss, doch der ist jetzt leer! 

Deswegen musste schnell mal ein Sido Album her! 

(Hast du Pläne für die Zukunft? Wenn ja, welche?) 

Es klingt vielleicht seltsam, doch Ich will Geld hab'n! 

(Und noch ein Wort an deine Fans zum Schluss!) 

Ihr seid mir alle egal, Ich rap´ nur weil ich muss! 



Hook: 



Komm und frag mich! Erzähl den Leuten wer ich bin! 

Stell deine Fragen, mach ein Bild von mir und schreib es hin! 

Komm und frag mich! Erzähl ihnen von mir! 

Frag mich und schreib mein Leben auf Papier!

"When we met, it was in the hot green jungle
Your perfect flesh impervious to anything fungal
You would sweat coconut milk and
I'd lie awake, restless with the heat during the night
Dawn would come and I would start to feel my own sunrise

But you'd just lie, sleeping



And so we went away in search of gentler breezes

When we arrived, I longed to lie and rustle in your grasses

But you would not permit me to retire there

None but a fly might settle on the meadow of your leg



Dawn would come and I would start to feel my own sunrise

But you'd just lie, sleeping



Then we moved on until we reached the tundra in the winter

Of course I longed to kiss her frosty teeth in the cold air

But now I've grown bloated on seal fat

Not even flies will settle on the meadow of her leg



Dawn would come and I would start to feel my own sunrise

But you'd just lie, sleeping",Rock

To ride on the crest of a wild raging storm
To work in the service of life and the living
In search of the answers to questions unknown
To be part of the movement and part of the growing
Part of beginning to understand



Aye, Calypso, the places you've been to

The things that you've shown us

The stories you tell

Aye, Calypso, I sing to your spirit

The men who have served you

So long and so well



Like the dolphin who guides you

You bring us beside you

To light up the darkness and show us the way

For though we are strangers in your silent world

To live on the land we must learn from the sea

To be true as the tide

And free as the wind-swell

Joyful and loving in letting it be

It's the happiest that I've ever been

How to do much more than just hold hands

And the only sound is the beat of my heart.

I see you beckoning to the place that ends where I thought it should start.



You made everything easy -

There was nothing to think of at all.

Now you don't believe,

And here it comes again...

Sold right and all,

They wandered around and round my mouth,

They stole my lie,

Sold right and all,

They have been the ones who've seen enough



They went back on us

I could know when to come on to it

It's the thought that emerges

You can't hear me

Can't defeat you

Super lovers, tell me where you got yours

Yoji Yamamoto, I'm hanging with the locals

Where the catwalk got its claws, all you fashion know-it-alls

With your underground malls in the world of Harajuku

Putting on a show, when you dress up in your clothes

Wild hair color and cell phones

Your accessories are dead on

You dress so fly and just parade around (arigato)

Just an American girl, in the Tokyo streets

My boyfriend bought me a Hysteric Glamour shirt

They're hard to find in the states, got me feeling couture (it's really cool)

What's that you got on? Is it Comme des Garcons?

Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong, mixed up with second hand clothes

Flipped the landscape when Nigo made A Bathing Ape

I got expensive taste (oh, well) guess I better save up (cho takai)

A Ping-Pong match between eastern and western

Did you see your inspiration in my latest collection?

Just wait 'til you get your little hands on L.A.M.B.,

'Cause it's (super kawaii), that means (super cute in Japanese)

And I wonder as I wander by the river
Where my love has flown



All the birds in the cottonwood above her

Know I love her

Know I care

Seem to vanish

In the air



I wonder where



So I wonder as I wander

Must I live ever after

"See the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big.
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it
Was just a twig



Then the first snow came 

And she ran out to brush the snow away

So it wouldn't die

Came runnin' in all excited 

Slipped and almost hurt herself

And I laughed 'til I cried



She was always young at heart

Kinda dumb and kinda smart

And I loved her so

And I surprised her with a puppy

Kept me up all Christmas Eve

Two years ago



And it would sure embarass her

When I came in from workin' late

'Cause I would know

That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'

Over some sad and silly

Late, late show



And Honey I miss you

And I'm being good

And I'd love to be with you

If only I could



She wrecked the car and she was sad

And so afraid that I'd be mad

But what the heck

Though I pretended hard to be

Guess you could say she saw through me

And hugged my neck



I came home unexpectedly 

And caught her cryin' needlesly

In the middle of the day

And it was in the early Spring

When flowers bloom and Robins sing

She went away



And Honey I miss you

And I'm being good

And I'd love to be with you

If only I could



One day while I was not at home 

While she was there and all alone

The angels came

Now all I have is memories 

Of Honey and I wake up nights

And call her name



Now my life's an empty stage

Where Honey lived and Honey played

And love grew up

And a small cloud passes over head

And cries down on the flower bed

That Honey loved



And see the tree how big it's grown

But friend, it hasn't been too long

It wasn't big

You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost 
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey 
They tell me your passion's gone away 
And I don't need no carryin' on 


You stand in the line just to hit a new low 

You're faking a smile with the coffee to go 

You tell me your life's been way off line 

You're falling to pieces everytime 

And I don't need no carryin' on

You're taking one down 

You sing a sad song just to turn it around

You tell me don't lie

You're coming back down and you really don't mind

And the whole thing turns out wrong 

You might not make it back and you know 

That you could be well oh that strong 

And I'm not wrong



So where is the passion when you need it the most 

Oh you and I 

You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost 



Cause you had a bad day 

You're taking one down 

You sing a sad song just to turn it around 

You say you don't know 

You tell me don't lie 

You work at a smile and you go for a ride 

You had a bad day 

You've seen what you like 

And how does it feel for one more time

my six string in my hand,

a chorus of voices singing along,

"Well did I tell you before
When I was up
Anxiety was bringing me down
I'm tired of listening to you
Talking in rhymes
Twisting round to make me think

You're straight down the line

All you do to me is talk talk



If every sign that I see is complete

Then I'm a fool in your game

And all you want to do

Is tell me your lies

Won't show the other side

You're just wasting my time



All you do to me is talk talk



When every choice that I make is yours

Keep telling me what's right and what's wrong

Don't you ever stop to think about me

I'm not that blind to see

That you've been cheating on me

Crying for me when I'm down

Laughing at me when I'm up

Crying for me

Watching the days go by, I started to cry

I'll travel 'round the seven seas for you

It's written in the melody I adore you

I wrote my love a symphony

To show you there's nothing I won't do

Baby I'll walk around the China Wall

for you

If there's a way I'll do it all for you

Anything you want me to, you know

I would do



People think I'm crazy, they say

I'm just a nothing

Letting my life pass me by

believing you're with me

Well I can't speak for no one

but in my heart I know you love me

And that's why I'll always tell you I

oh I, oh I, oh I

Am ruhigen Abendhimmel steht
Ein brennender Planet.
Ich wünschte, der Moment verstreicht
Niemals, weil nichts der Wärme

Deiner Liebe gleicht.



Selbst zwischen tausend Sonnen

Erstrahlt Dein Herz am hellsten,

Ein Schein, der mich

Auf allen Wegen führt.

Die Netze sind gesponnen,

Mir kann nichts mehr passieren,

Denn Deine Hand

Hat meine Haut berührt.



Der Seele nah, dem Körper fern,

Auf einem abgeleg'nen Stern

Betrachten wir den Feuerball

Und schleudern Tränen in das All



Du siehst mich an

Sehnsucht durchdringt

Den Abschied, in mir spielt

Ein Lied das nie verklingt:



Seit Du als Wind in jedes

Off'ne Fenster wehst,

Seit du als Baum in jedem

Wald der Erde stehst,

Seit du als Fluss in jedes

Stille Wasser fließt

Und Dich als Regen über

Jedem Land ergießt,

Seit Du Dich als das Lächeln

HInter meinem Spiegel zeigst,

Mit mir in Träumen weit hinauf,

Über die Wolken steigst,

Seit mir das Leben diesen

Einen Anblick bot:



Seitdem verlor ich alles,

Auch die Angst vor meinem Tod.",Rock

sort of like the Predators dreads

rock your whole block radius

I be the bomb

and I bleed nitrogliceren if you slice my palm

wet more domes than John the baptist

no retreat, no surrender, keep the cannons blastin'

always prepared physically, take the clip for the gun

Feathers fall from angel wings, from the sky. 
Father Satan gather your legions, it is time to claim your throne.
The arrival of your dominion, so long been gone.

So gather now my legions, it is time to fight for our lord.

Hail Satan, scream the masses, smeared in angel's blood.



Lords of war, the wings of twelve, open all the gates.

Fly high into the canopy; bring to me the head of god.

Hell lord, unholy father.

Your wish is my command.

I will cut the liar throat; Christian blood will fall to the ground.



Demon legions, fly through the gates.

Into the darkened sky.

Held up high, the spears of evil.

As they run, through angels flesh.

They scream out in pain, as they see their kingdom fall.

Angel tears fall to the ground, as Satan again will reign.

Love ain't got me downhearted 
I know up around the corner lies 
My fool's paradise 
In just another roll of the dice 



All my elevens and sevens been comin' up 

Sixes and nines 

But since I fell for you baby 

Been comin' on changin' times 

They're waitin' over the rise 

Just another roll of the dice 



I've stumbled and I know I made my mistakes 

But tonight I'm gonna be playin' for all of the stakes 



Well it's never too late so come on girl 

The tables are waiting 

You and me and lady luck well tonight 

We'll be celebrating 

Drinkin' champagne on ice 

In just another roll of the dice 



High-rollers lay down your bets and I'll raise 'em 

Well I know the odds ain't in my favor 



Maybe I'm just a clown throwin' down 

Lookin' to come up busted 

I'm a thief in the house of love 

And I can't be trusted 

Well I'll be makin' my heist 

In just another roll of the dice 

Just another roll of the dice 

Move on up 

Come on seven 

Roll me baby

"You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time I'm trying not to go too far, cause
No matter how it starts it ends the same

Someone's always doing someone more

Trading in the passion for that taste of pain

It's only gonna happen again



It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high

It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high

It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry

All night... all night



And though I'm trying not to look in your eyes

Each time I do they kind of burn right through me

Don't want to lay down in a bed full of lies

And yet my heart is saying come and do me



Now we're just a web of mystery

A possibility of more to come

I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be

But here I go falling again



It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high

It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high

"Through acrid clouds of summer flies
the garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
clawing at the grave of the dead nazarene
I watch the storm approaching

the darkness calls my name

the trees are growing restless

they feel the season change

their fruit has putrified

forbidden once and bound to die

the thread of life lies severed

on the brink of paradise



Grinning winds of hate unfurled

dash towers tall that grip the sun

talons stretch her veil

reclamation, our time has come...



Autumn spreads its golden wings

and lays the path for those unseen

a tangled web of evil spun at last...

Winter spawn from barren thighs

to readdress, to slay the blind

and throw the reins untethered to the skies



They pray to the full moon rising

Diana moving with such infinite grace

wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall

how many secrets can they read by your face?



Will they know of majesty

of beauty held in dream-dead sleep

and scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?

Will their ""god"" of bridled love

assuage our rule from planes above

or shrink in fear from Chaos roused for war?



WAR!



Wrest askew the nails

that have held you, lurking deep

September prayers are waning

burn the shrines of fettered sheep

Spearhead the insurrection

of a world that seeks no end

""We are what we are, what we shall be, again...""



Appear; draped in terror

to the comfort of your kin

Stain the milky sunset red

and let the other in...

"Imperfection inherent
This disorder in creation of life
Within this endless reign
Vision of lost words rise
Black god to raise hate in veins of the apocalypse
Holocaust of this testament in perceived idea of doom

The left hand of darkness shall bring this final redemption

Conspiracy in the offerings shall ring in horns of requiem

The principle power of deception in tainting the idol's blood

Held in this testimony for the opening of revelation

Unleash the revenge

Bound in the inverted rites

Raise the great wargate in promise of the fallen ones

Adorned in rank through dark incantations, marching forth

Disfigure in abstract reason

Embrace the blind god

Suspension of this balance will break and fall

Be the sword of evil in dissecting of this praise of mercy

Monumental torture within the halls of the cleansed

Perverse in this exploration of a medium absorbed in fear

This lifeless blasphemy will assume the form of wrath

Desecration

An arousing repulsion to this spirited resistance

This desolate becoming

Supremacy

In attaining this oblivion

This force of hell

Great heavens will burn

Bastard in praise with tainted thought

Creation in death

Bound in nails

Great crown of razors

This truth bathed in lies

Fascination of the compelling terror that lies within dark hearts

Warning of the coming horsemen

These revelations will bring sacrifice

Descending

Chained under the earth

The judgment of rebirth

Arise from flame and blood

Revolt of descent

Rebellion in swarms

Dying forgiveness for unanswered prayers",Rock

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash

He did the monster mash

The monster mash

It was a graveyard smash

He did the mash

It caught on in a flash

He did the mash

He did the monster mash



From my laboratory in the castle east

To the master bedroom where the vampires feast

The ghouls all came from their humble abodes

To get a jolt from my electrodes



They did the mash

They did the monster mash

The monster mash

It was a graveyard smash

They did the mash

It caught on in a flash

They did the mash

They did the monster mash



The zombies were having fun

The party had just begun

The guests included Wolf Man

Dracula and his son



The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds

Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds

The coffin-bangers were about to arrive

With their vocal group, ""The Crypt-Kicker Five""



They played the mash

They played the monster mash

The monster mash

It was a graveyard smash

They played the mash

It caught on in a flash

They played the mash

They played the monster mash



Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring

Seems he was troubled by just one thing

He opened the lid and shook his fist

And said, ""Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?""

It's now the monster mash

And it's a graveyard smash

It's now the mash

It's caught on in a flash

It's now the mash

When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you

And laugh at me

I know I can let go

I thought I should tell you

That I made my last mistake

I thought I should tell you

You're living a dream

You're holding on so tight

You're living the way you think you should be

Churning sea of Absu
Place of weeping death

Tiamat, dark serpent

Lord of the morbid priests

Enraged with hate for god

The priests of chaos chant

From the book of the worm

They burn the symbols of christ



We spit on the virgin lamb

And mock the words he spoke

His ways not worthy of me

We choose to burn in the pits of hell



Wreakers of death and havoc

Inflicting never ending pain

Sing the words of emptiness

Formulas of death

Call the queens of hell

And the god of the dead

The sea of Absu rolls

Rising spirit of Nar-Marratuk!!!



Bow down before the master

And pray the defeat of God Dog

Prayer of the ensnarers

Blind fiends of chaos rule



Rise up o powers of the sea

In the name of Absu I call

Come and carry my curse

To the ones who me disgust

May they burn in my cauldron

For they are as molten wax

So made it be



Liars in wait, priests of the night

Make images to burn by the moon

Robbing the spirit, raping god's law

Send up our hate to burn heavens gate",Rock

"[Chorus:]
If it's hate that you speak (go to hell)
And if you prey upon the weak (go to hell)
Spreading lies and deceit (go to hell)
Eternal flames fill the heat (go to hell)
And if you cannot make a menz (go to hell)

And if you follow every trend (go to hell)

And if you back stab your friends (go to hell)

If you ain't down till the end (go to hell)



The chosen one the wicked son, they call me Hitchcock

Talk some shit, and I'm a hitcha with this quick glock

Body butchered scattered and sealed up in zip locks

With my steel caps get peeled up to six blocks

You can try to get away but you won't get far

They call me Prozak bitch the knighted templar

I'm blown your fucking brain like the death star

And lyrics come to me like ghost from the grave yard



Since my birth I've been obsessed with the dead

Homacidal thoughts while I was being breast fed

I tryed to kill myself but I survived instead

From peices of a broken mirror sliced my wrist bled



Shit my wicked rhymes will have you overdose, and leave your ass comatose

You try to play me close I'll levitate to smoke

When I hit the fucking stage be like what's that smell

Sulfer and brimstone bitch go to hell



If it's hate that you speak (go to hell)

And if you prey upon the weak (go to hell)

Spreading lies and deceit (go to hell)

Eternal flames fill the heat (go to hell)

And if you cannot make a menz (go to hell)

And if you follow every trend (go to hell)

And if you back stab your friends (go to hell)

If you ain't down till the end (go to hell)



(They call me Hitchcock)

The radios afraid to play my wicked paragraphs

Go to the satation lock and load up on they whole staff

And let them know the danger of us crossing paths

And let it be known I spit the truth like a polygraph

Search on a time homie copy that

There's always room for another carbon copy cat

They try to run with my style but I got it back

And try to sound just like me with your head in half

(Go to hell)



If it's hate that you speak (go to hell)

And if you prey upon the weak (go to hell)

Spreading lies and deceit (go to hell)

Eternal flames fill the heat (go to hell)

And if you cannot make a menz (go to hell)

And if you follow every trend (go to hell)

And if you back stab your friends (go to hell)

If you ain't down till the end (go to hell)",Rap
"Toe to toe
Dancing very slow
Barely breathing
Almost comatose
Wall to wall
People hypnotised

And they're stepping lightly

Hang each night in Rapture



Back to back

Sacrailiac

Spineless movement

And a wild attack



Face to face

Sadly solitude

And it's finger popping

Twenty-four hour shopping in Rapture



Fab Five Freddie told me everybody's high

DJ's spinnin' are savin' my mind

Flash is fast, Flash is cool

Francois sez fas, Flashe' no do

And you don't stop, sure shot

Go out to the parking lot

And you get in your car and you drive real far

And you drive all night and then you see a light

And it comes right down and lands on the ground

And out comes a man from Mars

And you try to run but he's got a gun

And he shoots you dead and he eats your head

And then you're in the man from Mars

You go out at night, eatin' cars

You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too

Mercurys and Subarus

And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars

Then, when there's no more cars

You go out at night and eat up bars where the people meet

Face to face, dance cheek to cheek

One to one, man to man

Dance toe to toe

Don't move to slow, 'cause the man from Mars

Is through with cars, he's eatin' bars

Yeah, wall to wall, door to door, hall to hall

He's gonna eat 'em all

Rapture, be pure

Take a tour, through the sewer

Don't strain your brain, paint a train

You'll be singin' in the rain

I said don't stop, do punk rock



Well now you see what you wanna be

Just have your party on TV

'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars when the TV's on

And now he's gone back up to space

Where he won't have a hassle with the human race

And you hip-hop, and you don't stop

Just blast off, sure shot

'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars

And now he only eats guitars, get up!",Rock

Where I have been before
If I don't gind my love sometime

The one whose meant for me

Biding my time, trying to find a heart that's lonely

Looking for her, my love my one and only

Maybe I'll dream, tonight about the girl who'll be coming my way

So I'll take this chance and celebrate the day

When I'm making my way through an open door

I've got some love and so much more

And I?m ready to make someone mine

You're running on thin air

Why does luck happen by suprise

If you don't really care

From fires that have burned

New ideals and different thoughts

From lessons I have learned

To find that smile

Put my faith in another piece of good advice

Waiting for, a little something more

Electric slows and the sun can't make things grow?

Will he see his Sarah? he yearned

Her apartment is the one that's burned - he runs



The boys gather in the thick of the dump

Weapons ready and adrenalin begins to pump

Time to turn the boys into men

The sons of Batman will ride again tonight



The throng moves man of steel falls

James Gordon finds her in his arms - she bawls

The Gotham jail has gone up for grabs

In Gotham City he's not out of a job tonight



Onto the scene rides the man of old

Nerves of steel bat blood of cold

Now no embrace can quite replace

There was a wind in the wild rough grasses and a broad swelling heat when it stops
Standin' at the edge of creation at the base of the throne of the sky

Come and see your daughter again.



I directed my stride to the river and the near by great beyond

The broken stalkes of the harvest, pale as bone in the dawn

Pulled forward and drawn onward like water called to the sea

My hands are always full or empty and my boots are always carrying me.



A big eyed girl in the hallway.

Borrowed light from the moon

I kissed her lips with my own mouth

I swear I will be back soon.



I caught hope one handed. It was two days old in the dirt.

My arms grew weak in their sockets like tender stalks of longing and hurt

Tore themselves to shreds

Para dejar a la manada frenetica

La luna llena como una fruta

No da consejos ni los escucha



Llevo conmigo un radar especial para localizar solteros

Si acaso me meto en aprietos tambien llevo el número de los bomberos

Ni tipos muy lindos ni divos ni niños ricos yo se lo que quiero

Pasarla muy bien y portarme muy mal en los brazos de algún caballero



Una loba en el armario

Tiene ganas de salir

Deja que se coma el barrio

Antes de irte a dormir



Cuando son casi la una la loba en celo saluda a la luna

Duda si andar por la calle o entrar en un bar a probar fortuna

Ya está sentada en su mesa y pone la mira en su proxima presa

Pobre del desprevenido que no se esperaba una de esas



Sigilosa al pasar

Sigilosa al pasar

Esa loba es especial

Mirala caminar, caminar



Deja que se coma el barrio

If you're past the point of turning back

"I want to climb the highest peaks of the Universe
To reach the tallest mountains of the moon
I set my soul on fire, transcend this world of nothing
Imagination running mad to the extreme
I want to fly on the wings of the Firebird



I need to burn the distance, leave this old world below

My flesh is soon consumed in a crazy smoke

And endless source of power, eternal fire I'm breathing

My voice as a burning tongue the sun is licking

So I summon the fire elementals, the ones I'm keeping inside

I call for my imagination to rise and shine, to make my life...

"[Verse One:]
Alright I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back

My niggas warnin me that she was comin on to me

I react like a mack do I act cool

Just to test her cause I ain't no jester

I suggest her and her friend be outtie

Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy

And doubt me our friendship

But when lips touch

I go crazy in the clutch

Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals

I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do

Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em

Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic

Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin about

I didn't mean to

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)

Another incident when I went

Way beyond what I should of done

John should of stopped before them drawers dropped

But I didn't ain't no quittin

Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin

I admit skinz ain't a reason to lose friends

But then again I didn't know, sorry

Accept apologies and live on

Are we goin hold grudges well oh fudge

Its a new year and I do fear

Ya actions ya actin shy

I mean ya need to be smackin

That hoe

Instead of tryin to front on me ya know

Thats exactly how I'm goin to be ya know

I run my game on any G ya know

Cause we the most entertainin

I meant to blame women

For makin me do what the Ak seem to

When you call I screen you

I didn't mean to

[Verse Three:]



Why do fools be schememin dreamin

Actin like demons

Niggas don't give a fuck

Because they beat shit

To many girls front cute

When they want loot

They tell lies the swell guys

Can peep it and thats weak shit

Thats why I run game on every freak I get

Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short

I know the rules on the flooze so who's short

I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo

She tried to get me so I looked at the front door

And now shes not with me so forget it

But every once in a while I'll hit it

I didn't mean to and I been through

Your relationship and I hate dumb dips

But I really can't trip when they ride my tip

Fertile soil to all delusions

Reason in me rings hollow

Truth is dissonant in salvation's lullaby

A nihilist song of praise

To humbly sacrifice my judgment

And pledge allegiance to deceit

"En gammal man så trevlig och glad
Han hälsar trevligt på alla i sin stad
Solstrålar skiner där han vandrar fram
Och ingen tror att ondska bor i denna man
Men bakom ytan bor en djävul svart som få

Men den väntar tills mörkret faller på

Innan den krälar fram ur sitt hål

Och tänder eld på sitt bål



Han är en gammal man med trevliga dra

Som har skapat en egen lag

Och han ser inget fel i de brott han begått

Han är en Varg i Veum



En gång så ung så oskyldigt ren

Men åren gick och vindarna ven

Nu är han sargad han är rå han är kall

Han är ett levande exempel på förfall



Men bakom ytan bor en djävul svart som sot

Där i hans inre där har ingen satt sin fot

Men när mörkret faller på kommer den ut

Och då har glädjen sett sitt slut



Han är en gammal man...



Och det glänser i hans ögon

När han känner vilken makt han har

Makten över andras liv

Är den enda glädje han har kvar



Han är en gammal man...",Punk

"In the sky the phantom moon appears at midday

To join the sun in some forgotten dance






In their light our voices tremble with reflections



Of what we know and what we leave to chance







The heart can see beyond the sun



Beyond the turning moon



And as we look



The heart will teach us



All we need to learn







We have dreams, we hold them to the light like diamonds



Stones of the moon and splinters of the sun







Some we keep to light the dark nights on our journey



And shine beyond the days that we have won







The heart can see beyond our prayers



Beyond our fondest schemes



And tell us which are made for fools



And which are wise men's dreams







Trust your heart







Trust your heart",Jazz
"There at the borders
Cold and rigid guardians dressed of no life
We run and run in circles
Till the world stops spinning round
(Run in circles, and the world as we know it, spins in silence)
Till remaining breathless, panting

Overwhelmed by laughter

Starry skies of stains

Ultimately sorry

Uneducated random strokes of pain

It's a chain going backwards through the veins

Must sew up this wound and run away

I can feel their strength

Through crooked-lightning desert pathways

Run and run and run the pathways

branching off through time

Two lone-wolves shared

the utmost silence of the time

(run, run the pathways as you share

the uttermost of silence)

The first day of Spring
Every heart would have
A new song to sing
And we'd sing of the joy

As free as a bird

Every voice would be

A voice to be heard

Take my word

We would treasure each day

My world would be

A beautiful place

Where we would weave

Such a wonderful dream

My world would wear

A smile on its face

Like the man in the moon

When the moon beams



If I ruled the world

Every man would say

The world was his friend

There'd be happiness

That no man could end

No my friend

Not if I ruled the world

Every head

Would be held up high

There'd be sunshine

In everyone's sky

"No way forward or back, in stalemate, we stagnate,
life cycle is an automation, instinctively, we race to get ahead?

Another insignificance to join the rat race.
Self indulgence within our grasp.

The sanctity of life, so vulnerable,

the world keeps turning - we spin out of control.

Guided, or could this mean misguided, no time for questions,

preoccupied with pressing on, the world keeps turning -

we overdose on overdrive.

Superior species with inferior ideas.



We overload our bodies and minds,

respect this world while committing suicide.

Poison trait.



We're the cause not the cure,

our methods will surly drag us down.

And it turns you on

Vandals laced and braced for action

No sense, no consequence

Chain of life that turns the world around

Jack got so mean boy, he just had to fight

He died on the floor someone else evens the score

Back on the tables Jeannie's romance had died

That one look of love had told her a lie

And for her there's no waves crashing on seashores

I don't think y'all heard me!

I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day!

Every day the 14th!

Now when arrows don't penetrate, see

Cupid grabs the pistol (Uh, yeah, now, now lookie here!)

And he shoots straight for your heart

And when he won't miss you!

When Cupid knocks at your door

You can't ignore me!

There's no need to run!

I may have it all wrong, see

If you know what loves mean, well

Well, somebody tell me!

Below I know I love her, but act like I don't want her

Surrounded by the lonely, but yet feel like a loner

Could be an organ donor

The way I give up my heart, but

Never know because - shit, I never tell her!

Ask me about my feelings I'd holla' that it's irrela'

I don't get myself caught up in the Jello gella'

And puddin' pops, that others opt to call falling in love, but

For the record, have you ever rode a horse?

Would I like for you to take me to Pluto?

I said, ""Of course!""

But if you ain't a sweety indeedy, I won't endorse

Hans Solo till I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force

Be with you, and I'll hit you when better time permits

For now, give me examples of why you're the shit!

But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?

And if you do not know me, then how could you be my friend?
