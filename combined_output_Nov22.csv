I've got the rememdy
To burn your memories
I don't know if it can
Never be afraid
To live with the lies and pain

You're never going to be the same

I don't know if you can

I want to take it too far

Come on don't be shy

I want to make you go down down



(Chorus)

I can make you scream

How I live my life when I have no choice

I see it in your eyes you're crazy

Just scream

How it feels inside

Let me hear your voice

And make it loud this time it opens up my mind



Tell me what you see

I'm not your enemy

If that's what you want to be

I don't know if I can

When you scream my name

And I take all the blame

It's never going to be the same

I don't know if you care

I want to take it too far come on don't be shy

I want to make you go down down



(Chorus)



When you scream

Maybe you're in denial

t kills me I can see it it's on your face

I can't see

Now we're breaking the silence

When you scream

Let it go and you take it away

Maybe you're in denial

I can make you scream

I can see it it's on your face

When you scream

Now we're breaking the silence

I can make you scream

Let it go and ou take it away

TRAAAAW128F429D538,Casual,I Didn't Mean To,"[Verse One:]
Alright I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back

My niggas warnin me that she was comin on to me

I react like a mack do I act cool

Just to test her cause I ain't no jester

I suggest her and her friend be outtie

Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy

And doubt me our friendship

But when lips touch

I go crazy in the clutch

Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals

I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do

Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em

Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic

Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin about

I didn't mean to



[Chorus: x2]



It ain't my fault that your girl got caught

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)



[Verse Two:]



Another incident when I went

Way beyond what I should of done

John should of stopped before them drawers dropped

But I didn't ain't no quittin

Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin

I admit skinz ain't a reason to lose friends

But then again I didn't know, sorry

Accept apologies and live on

Are we goin hold grudges well oh fudge

Its a new year and I do fear

Ya actions ya actin shy

I mean ya need to be smackin

That hoe

Instead of tryin to front on me ya know

Thats exactly how I'm goin to be ya know

I run my game on any G ya know

Cause we the most entertainin

I meant to blame women

For makin me do what the Ak seem to

When you call I screen you

I didn't mean to



[Chorus]





[Verse Three:]



Why do fools be schememin dreamin

Actin like demons

Niggas don't give a fuck

Because they beat shit

To many girls front cute

When they want loot

They tell lies the swell guys

Can peep it and thats weak shit

Thats why I run game on every freak I get

Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short

I know the rules on the flooze so who's short

I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo

She tried to get me so I looked at the front door

And now shes not with me so forget it

But every once in a while I'll hit it

And it happened to be your girl

I didn't mean to and I been through

Your relationship and I hate dumb dips

But I really can't trip when they ride my tip

I didn't mean to

Where I have been before
If I don't gind my love sometime
I'm walking out that door
Some may come and some may go
But no-one seems to be

The person I've been searching for

The one whose meant for me

Biding my time, trying to find a heart that's lonely

Looking for her, my love my one and only

Maybe I'll dream, tonight about the girl who'll be coming my way

So I'll take this chance and celebrate the day

When I'm making my way through an open door

I've got some love and so much more

And I?m ready to make someone mine

Making my way through an open door

I've got some love and so much more

And I'll find her, 'cos it's about time

You try too hard and it feels just like

You're running on thin air

Why does luck happen by suprise

If you don't really care

The past is gone the flames are out

From fires that have burned

New ideals and different thoughts

From lessons I have learned

Biding my time, trying to find a heart that's lonely

Looking for her, my love my one and only

Maybe I'll dream, tonight about the girl who'll be coming my way

So I'll take this chance and celebrate the day

I've got some love and so much more

And I?m ready to make someone mine

Making my way through an open door

I've got some love and so much more

And I'll find her, 'cos it's about time

Got the feeling this could take a pretty long while

To find that smile

Put my faith in another piece of good advice

Well I tried that twice

Waiting for, a little something more

To inspire, take me higher 

And I?m ready to make someone mine

Making my way through an open door

I've got some love and so much more

I'm a stranger in paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry-eyed
That's the danger in paradise

For mortals who stand beside an angel like you



I saw your face and I ascended

Out of the commonplace into the rare

Somewhere in space I hang suspended

Until I know there's a chance that you care



Won't you answer this fervent prayer

Of a stranger in paradise?

Don't send me in dark despair

From all that I hunger for



But open your angel's arms

To this stranger in paradise

And tell him that he need be

A stranger no more",Jazz,,Tony Bennett,Stranger In Paradise

I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find you

And I won't touch ground

Oh no

The road beyond was rocky

But now you're feeling cocky

You look at me and you see your past

Is that the reason

Why you're running so fast?

""Sei sulla buona strada"", mi dico pensando a te
la nebbia si dirada e tutto è più chiaro in me;
sì, sulla buona strada non voglio più guerra io
né prendere per terra i pezzi di un altro addio.
Non finirà, non finirà, come una scena crollata a metà.



Io, caduto sopra il mondo

a rincorrere il grande momento;

io, a credere che il tempo

ormai non mi spezzerà mai più.



Sei sulla buona strada, due ali nei passi miei

è tempo di rialzarsi, c'è tanta fiducia ormai;

Sì, sulla buona strada, che grande occasione c'è,

la giusta direzione si traccia davanti a me.

Non finirà, non finirà come un discorso lasciato a metà.



Io, caduto sopra il mondo

a difendere il mio grande sogno;

io, a credere ogni giorno:

qualcosa succederà per noi.



Silenzi disperati, (cercando tenere parole)

noi, pensieri spaventati, (innamorati di questa vita)

noi, sorrisi appena nati che non si fermano più, mai più.

qualcosa succederà per noi.",Pop,Rock,Riccardo Fogli,Sulla buona strada

To all those souls at rest.

Watching the briars grow.

I always believed that if I ran off to India
Wore sandals and shaved my head


And used Body shop conditioner, and incense like crazy



I could call myself a spirit head



But I only went to India to look on top



I wore sandals cause I'd smoked all my money



And I shaved off all my hair cause I had the fleas



I'd been sleeping all over



And the Body shop conditioner was a present from a friend



And the incense used to hide the smell



Of the drug den that I lay in







And so I ask myself what my motives are



For this lying need to look so free



And if I tell myself real honestly



What more can I admit to, open up a door



He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for



He said I'd find out soon



I got too much Saturn and not enough Moon











I always believed that if I never missed a Yoga class



Read my horoscope in the dailies



And recycle bottles, and know a Red Indian



I could call myself a spirit man



But I was only doing Yoga cause I fancied the teacher



And stars cause it looked good on paper



And I only went to church cause my granny gave me money



When confession was over



And I only knew the Indian cause his brother's a dealer



And bottles had a price on their return



So I could go and play, Oh my my











And so I ask myself what my motives are



For this lying need to look so free



And if I tell myself real honestly



What more can I admit to, open up a door



He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for



He said I'd find out soon



I got too much Saturn and not enough Moon











So now that you know why I don't love you



And now that you see that I'm so scared



Am I a good man ?



Am I a deep deep man ?











What more can I admit to, open up a door



He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for



He said I'd find out soon

She was sweeter than the blooming rose
So early in the spring.
Her thoughts were gay and happy
And the morning gay and fine,

For her lover was a river boy

From the river in the pines.



Now Charlie, he got married

To his Mary in the spring

When the trees were budding early

And the birds began to sing.

But early in the autumn

When the fruit is in the wine,

I'll return to you, my darling

From the river in the pines.



It was early in the morning

In Wisconsin's dreary clime

When he rode the fatal rapids

For that last and fatal time.

They found his body lying

On the rocky shore below

Where the silent water ripples

And the whispering cedars blow.



Now every raft of lumber

That comes down the Chippewa,

There's a lonely grave that's

Visited by drivers on their way

They plant wild flowers upon it

In the morning fair and fine.

TRAAKMX128F934B494,Vomitory,Gore Apocalypse,"[Music T. Gustafsson, Lyrics E. Rundqvist]
Screams surround everything, anxiety-ridden fear
Hundred piled corpses
Mixed with those alive, a rotten mess
Penetrated by death



In sludge of body parts crawl those who still breathe

Cold dead corpses

Crushed beneath still screaming bodies

Bowels gushed from wounds



Stream into pools of blood

Floats into a sea of death



Dead or buried alive

The skin burst underground

Suffocated by a hundred corpses

Broken bodies decompose



Stream into pools of blood

Floats into a sea of death",Rock,Metal,Vomitory,Gore Apocalypse

That you were never gonna be this way
And the only thing that you've ever known is to run
So you keep on drivin' faster into the sun

But everybody needs somebody sometimes

Yeah everybody needs somebody sometimes



You don't have to find your own way out

You've got a voice let it be heard

Just when it feels you're on a dead-end road

There's always somewhere left to turn

So don't give up now you're so close to a brand new day

Yes you are

And if you just can't bare to be alone then I'll stay

Yeah everybody needs somebody sometimes

Well maybe I've been too caught up

To see what you've been goin' through

All that I can say is I'm here now

clawing at the grave of the dead nazarene
I watch the storm approaching

the darkness calls my name

the trees are growing restless

they feel the season change

their fruit has putrified

forbidden once and bound to die

the thread of life lies severed

on the brink of paradise



Grinning winds of hate unfurled

dash towers tall that grip the sun

talons stretch her veil

reclamation, our time has come...



Autumn spreads its golden wings

and lays the path for those unseen

a tangled web of evil spun at last...

Winter spawn from barren thighs

to readdress, to slay the blind

and throw the reins untethered to the skies



They pray to the full moon rising

Diana moving with such infinite grace

wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall

how many secrets can they read by your face?



Will they know of majesty

of beauty held in dream-dead sleep

and scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?

Will their ""god"" of bridled love

assuage our rule from planes above

or shrink in fear from Chaos roused for war?



WAR!



Wrest askew the nails

that have held you, lurking deep

September prayers are waning

burn the shrines of fettered sheep

Spearhead the insurrection

of a world that seeks no end

[Verse One: Inspectah Deck]

Ryzarector, Madman, uh, uhh, yo, uhh

I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light

Invite the fight, we all die tonight

The life I lived, a 25 to life bid

Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive

CREAM is short, C-cypher power stalk plus the fiend talk

Three G's accost in Supreme Court

White lies and blackmail land me back in jail

We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail

Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind

It comes time I take back what was once mine

Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter

Devil's poisonin the birth water

The earth daughter rest her head on my chest

Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest

While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blastin

Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened, shhhh

Trapped in deep-water gaspin

I Clash With the Titans from my half on the action



[Verse Two: RZA]

I stop producers careers, the weak spot was their ears

Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears

You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered

Devils still peeled it still they're living built tilted

MC's upon their axis, their body has a tactic

Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice

You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable

One nation under God, indivisible

With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches

Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches

Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel

Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable

Interchangable, caution flameable

My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable, angles

And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle

Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal

Retrieve through your doors

Seep out like sweat through the pores

Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare



[Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef]

(Assassination day)

First of all, before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon

Don, spread it out like Grey Poupon

Splurgin, mergin in the suburbs, using this just like an adverb

Action word, flowing like a blackbird

God came in, aimin like Terry Bradshaw

He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pah

You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga

Hold on like bullet-proof Acuras

You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high

Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shootin it like they blew top snow

You won't play me like your lady

Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby

Final destination Haiti



[Verse Four: Masta Killa]

War is extremely serious and it saddens me

To have to take tings to deadly measures

And have you measured and shot for no pay

It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey

Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives

And lures MC's to the lair

With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed

Temptation tempts my victim to proceed

Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat

You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat

Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in 

Murdereous rhymin, constantly in climbin

My mind spits with an enormous kickback

Your brain didn't absorb the impact

Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback...

Drop off and let the others through

In reds and whites and blacks and blues

And in a big tall building she lets out her hair into the street

Where cars and trucks career through it

Until the ends get wrecked and split

by dividing those involved
choosing cult names and hatred

the gutter press said punks should spit and fight

and the puppet punks were fooled alright

they began to sniff aerosol and tubes of glue

because the paper said that's what real punks do

like spitting on bands covering them in shit

even though they knew if they were playing, they wouldn't like it

the promoters wanted to put a stop

to the cheap gigs bands arranged on their own

so they introduced more lies and once the seeds were sown

the puppet punks began to smash up halls

believing they were having a real ball

but the destruction meant nothing at all

they were just dancing to the tunes

the big businessmen called

very soon bands couldn't afford to do their own gigs

and the promoters had won

they got their own way

protecting their halls with bouncers

they decided which bands could play

and best of all they controlled the price that we all have to pay

punk belongs to the punks

not the businessmen

they need us, we don't need them

punk will never be dead

as long as some of us refuse to be led

You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea

You better look it over

And you know I'm fine

Sometimes they justify my claim

And the public don't dwell on my transmission

Cause it wasn't televised

As another flash struck to the ground

he recovered from his sleep.

So strong was his urge to test his might

but still he was too weak.



Who has no rites of passage undergone,

he cannot rule the thunder.

The first step is always to humble

and to learn the might of the gods.



Anger he felt, grabbed a thunderbolt

and across the heavens hate echoed!



An adolescent he is to ride a stormy cloud.

So young to carry the faintest bolt of lightning.

Alone he walks his path of honour.

Such skill wasted in lack of strength.



Too bold he was to learn - a grand punishment

deserved.

Under a half exposed moon
So secure if we stay here forever we still would have to go
Go and leave too soon
But it's all just a dream

The next day you didn't know me

And it's all just a dream

The next day you didn't hold me

And it hurts, hurts so bad

To have my sweet next day remind me

My sweet next day remind me

That it's all just a dream away



I had a dream that you wrote me a letter

Oh your kisses placed so gently over every sentence formed oh it felt so warm

And the words you wrote them with so much conviction

Sweet like your perfumed neck that you rub the paper on



But it's all just a dream

The next day you didn't know me

And it's all just a dream

The next day you didn't hold me

Beacuse I need that dollar every day of the weak

So keep your balance, and don't you slip

TRAAWHT128F427072D,Beastie Boys,Paul Revere,"How here's a little story - I've got to tell
About three bad brothers - you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock, M.C.A., and me - Mike D.
Been had a little horsy named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer

Riding across the land - kicking up sand

Sheriff's posse on my tail cause I'm in demand

One lonely Beastie I be

All by myself - without nobody

The sun is beating down on my baseball hat

The air is gettin' hot - the beer is getting flat

Lookin' for a girl - I ran into a guy

His name is M.C.A., I said, ""Howdy"" - he said, ""Hi""



He told a little story - that sounded well rehearsed

Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst

The brew was in my hand - and he was on my tip

His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry - he asked me for a sip

He said, ""Can I get some?""

I said, ""You can't get none!""

Had a chance to run

He pulled out his shotgun

He was quick on the draw - I thought I'd be dead

He put the gun to my head and this is what he said,



""Now my name is M.C.A. - I've got a license to kill

I think you know what time it is - it's time to get ill

Now what do we have here - an outlaw and his beer

I run this land, you understand - I make myself clear.""

We stepped into the wind - he had a gun, I had a grin

You think this story's over but it's ready to begin



""Now I got the gun - you got the brew

You got two choices of what you can do

It's not a tough decision as you can see

I can blow you away or you can ride with me"" I said, I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border

The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter

I did it like this - I did it like that

I did it with a whiffleball bat

So I'm on the run - the cop's got my gun

And right about now - it's time to have some fun

The King Adrock - that is my name

And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.""

We rode for six hours the we hit the spot

The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot

This dude was staring like he knows who we are

We took the empty spot next to him at the bar

M.C.A. said, ""Yo, you know this kid?""

I said, ""I didn't."" - but I know he did

The kid said, ""Get ready cause this ain't funny

My name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money.""

Pulled out the jammy - aimed it at the sky

He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" - and let two fly

Hands went up and people hit the floor

He wasted two kids that ran for the door

""I'm Mike D. and I get respect

Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect""

M.C.A. was with it and he's my ace

So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face

The piano player's out - the music stopped

His boy had beef - and he got dropped

Mike D. grabbed the money - M.C.A. snatched the gold

I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold",Rock,,Paul Revere & The Raiders,I Had A Dream

yelling loud

telling us

we should be proud

of what we done

but it takes guts

to give it up

one on one

and if you run

when you are young

when you are old

you'll remember when

you had the chance

to have it all

TRAAWSJ128F933D7EF,Gerry Rafferty,Baker Street (Edit),"Windin' your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day
You'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold.

It's got so many people but it's got no soul

And it's taking you so long

To find out you were wrong

When you thought it had everything



You used to think that it was so easy

You used to say that it was so easy

But you're tryin'

You're tryin' now

Another year and then you'll be happy

Just one more year and then you'll be happy

But you're cryin'

You're cryin' now



Way down the street there's a lad in his place

He opens the door he's got that look on his face

And he asks you where you've been

You tell him who you've seen

And you talk about anything



He's got this dream about buyin' some land

He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands

And then he'll settle down there's a quiet little town

And forget about everything



But you know he'll always keep movin'

You know he's never gonna stop movin

Cus he's rollin'

He's the rollin' stone



And when you wake up it's a new mornin'

The sun is shinin' it's a new morning

You're goin'

You're goin' home.",Pop,Rock,Gerry Rafferty,Baker Street (Edit)
TRAAWUM128F427D81D,Assembly of Dust,Harrower,"Steppin' out on the great lawn in the new green shoots of a crop
There was a wind in the wild rough grasses and a broad swelling heat when it stops
Standin' at the edge of creation at the base of the throne of the sky
By the mouth of the Tennessee River where the birds of another world fly
Well I must be on my way the share croppers say there's barely even work for them. 

I'll come rolling back to town when my fortune comes around. 

Come and see your daughter again.



I directed my stride to the river and the near by great beyond

The broken stalkes of the harvest, pale as bone in the dawn

Pulled forward and drawn onward like water called to the sea

My hands are always full or empty and my boots are always carrying me.



A big eyed girl in the hallway.

Borrowed light from the moon

I kissed her lips with my own mouth

I swear I will be back soon.



I caught hope one handed. It was two days old in the dirt.

My arms grew weak in their sockets like tender stalks of longing and hurt

I would love to stay and talk it over but sir I am afraid it's to late",Rock,,Assembly of Dust,Harrower

TRAAXSY128F426F4EA,Bob Dylan,Tangled up in Blue,"Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough

They never did like Mama's homemade dress

Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.

And I was standin' on the side of the road

Rain fallin' on my shoes

Heading out for the East Coast

Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,

Tangled up in blue.



She was married when we first met

Soon to be divorced

I helped her out of a jam, I guess,

But I used a little too much force.

We drove that car as far as we could

Abandoned it out West

Split up on a dark sad night

Both agreeing it was best.

She turned around to look at me

As I was walkin' away

I heard her say over my shoulder,

""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""

Tangled up in blue.



I had a job in the great north woods

Working as a cook for a spell

But I never did like it all that much

And one day the ax just fell.

So I drifted down to New Orleans

Where I happened to be employed

Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat

Right outside of Delacroix.

But all the while I was alone

The past was close behind,

I seen a lot of women

But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew

Tangled up in blue.



She was workin' in a topless place

And I stopped in for a beer,

I just kept lookin' at the side of her face

In the spotlight so clear.

And later on as the crowd thinned out

I's just about to do the same,

She was standing there in back of my chair

Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""

I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,

She studied the lines on my face.

I must admit I felt a little uneasy

When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,

Tangled up in blue.



She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe

""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said

""You look like the silent type.""

Then she opened up a book of poems

And handed it to me

Written by an Italian poet

From the thirteenth century.

And every one of them words rang true

And glowed like burnin' coal

Pourin' off of every page

Like it was written in my soul from me to you,

Tangled up in blue.



I lived with them on Montague Street

In a basement down the stairs,

There was music in the cafes at night

And revolution in the air.

Then he started into dealing with slaves

And something inside of him died.

She had to sell everything she owned

And froze up inside.

And when finally the bottom fell out

I became withdrawn,

The only thing I knew how to do

Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,

Tangled up in blue.



So now I'm goin' back again,

I got to get to her somehow.

All the people we used to know

They're an illusion to me now.

Some are mathematicians

Some are carpenter's wives.

Don't know how it all got started,

I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.

But me, I'm still on the road

Headin' for another joint

We always did feel the same,

We just saw it from a different point of view,

Get it crunk, get drunk and leave your house with somebody

True that, so homies don't bring your main misses 

Cause it's real deal mackin when it comes to the Chris's

And this could be your very last time seein her

One look at me and you better believe that I be g'n her

Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?



[God]

Excuse me my son, one question at a time

We were never born, and we will never die

In the essence, there Is no such thing as death

How could I write commandments and not have them kept?

The soul is eternal you just change form

Then you come back with a new face on

You can not limit love unless you lack understanding

To answer you yes there is life in other planets

The futures a mystery the past is history

Today is a gift that's why it is called the present

Life is so simple unless you make it confusing

The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using



[Sticky]

Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you

God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you



[Chorus]

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?

If you could talk to God



[Sticky]

Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?



[God]

Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity



[Sticky]

I can't think I feel life going down the drain

In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain



[God]

Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts

Your feelings will really erase what you been taught

Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth

I speak through you to aware the youth



[Sticky]

But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?



[God]

In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite

How can there be left if there was never right?

How can something know death if it never knew life?

How can you lose, if nobody won?

How can it be dark if there was never a sun?

That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed

Form must exist for part of themself to manifest



[Sticky]

But I never asked to be born, I hate my life

And if you are God dammit then show me the light

And tell me- what's the meaning of life?



[God]

The process of all life

is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self



[Sticky]

Is God a he or she is there one true religion?



[God]

I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending

We are all one and everything is living

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?

Holding winged insects in front of his eyes

Doing his penance for someone to see

The head in the alley was licking his papers

And thinking, ?He's thinking he's better than me?

And in roses just before you cut them down

There is danger in most everything

Then I know that you can always change your mind

[From ""Back to the future"" soundtrack]
The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing

Change a hawk to a little white dove

More than a feeling that's the power of love



Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream

Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream

Make a bad one good make a wrong one right

Power of love that keeps you home at night



You don't need money, don't take fame

Don't need no credit card to ride this train

It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes

But it might just save your life

That's the power of love

That's the power of love



First time you feel it, it might make you sad

Next time you feel it it might make you mad

But you'll be glad baby when you've found

That's the power makes the world go'round



And it don't take money, don't take fame

Don't need no credit card to ride this train

It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes

But it might just save your life



They say that all in love is fair

Yeah, but you don't care

But you know what to do

When it gets hold of you

And with a little help from above

You feel the power of love

You feel the power of love

Can you feel it ?

Hmmm



It don't take money and it don't take fame

Don't need no credit card to ride this train

Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel

You won't feel nothin' till you feel

You feel the power, just the power of love

So gather now my legions, it is time to fight for our lord.

I will cut the liar throat; Christian blood will fall to the ground.



Demon legions, fly through the gates.

Held up high, the spears of evil.

As they run, through angels flesh.

They scream out in pain, as they see their kingdom fall.

Angel tears fall to the ground, as Satan again will reign.

Niemals, weil nichts der Wärme

Erstrahlt Dein Herz am hellsten,

Ein Schein, der mich

Auf allen Wegen führt.

Die Netze sind gesponnen,

Mir kann nichts mehr passieren,

Denn Deine Hand

Hat meine Haut berührt.



Der Seele nah, dem Körper fern,

Auf einem abgeleg'nen Stern

Betrachten wir den Feuerball

Und schleudern Tränen in das All



Du siehst mich an

Sehnsucht durchdringt

Den Abschied, in mir spielt

Ein Lied das nie verklingt:



Seit Du als Wind in jedes

Off'ne Fenster wehst,

Seit du als Baum in jedem

Wald der Erde stehst,

Seit du als Fluss in jedes

Stille Wasser fließt

Und Dich als Regen über

Jedem Land ergießt,

Seit Du Dich als das Lächeln

HInter meinem Spiegel zeigst,

Mit mir in Träumen weit hinauf,

Über die Wolken steigst,

Seit mir das Leben diesen

Einen Anblick bot:



Seitdem verlor ich alles,

Auch die Angst vor meinem Tod.",Rock,RnB,Samsas Traum,Heiliges Herz (Thomas Rainer - Remix)

Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;

Memories always start 'round midnight

Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,

When my heart is still with you,

And ol' midnight knows it, too.

When a quarrel we had needs mending,

Does it mean that our love is ending.

Darlin' I need you, lately I find

You're out of my heart,

And I'm out of my mind.



Let our hearts take wings'

And she'll take what you give her as long as it's free

She can wait if she wants

She's ahead of her time

Oh, and she never gives out

And she never gives in

She just changes her mind

Than the Garden of Eden

Then she'll carelessly cut you

And laugh while you're bleedin'

But she'll bring out the best

And the worst you can be

Blame it all on yourself

Cause she's always a woman to me



She is frequently kind

And she's suddenly cruel

She can do as she pleases

She's nobody's fool

But she can't be convicted

She's earned her degree

He was lickin, and suckin on everything, just the way he should
This morning's extra lovin was good
We lay there sweaty, sex funky, happy as we want to be

Lovin exclusively, My man and me all night all morning

So our stomachs were growlin, hungrily

So I jumped up and rushed to the store

In hopes of coming back and getting a little more of

This morning's good extra lovin

At the market the people were pushing and shoving

Trying to be the next in line, the turn was mine

The new girl at the counter was cute, but not as fine as me

Was this some kind of women's intuition, some kind of insecurity

Nah, cuz my man is happy at home lovin me exclusively

So I shook my head, ¡°Wassup¡±

A tearless stare
encased by fear
like a thread my heart is torn
and ripped right from my soul

with no control



Suits in disguise then fades to red

brings a blackened sky to fall

and make you very cold

while you grow old



Gone whithout a trace (gone)

it's left me chained and bound

my heart you thrust a dagger

my life and dreams are shattered

and left in tyranny



Rapture or pain

you spill my blood and take my life away

rapture or pain

all adversions still remain



You've realized

you're not alone

they've took your breath of life

and left your mind to unfold

lifeless and cold



Your thoughts erased

it's death you taste

your searing face

it hides the scars of love



Gone whithout a trace (gone)

it's left me chained and bound

my heart you thrust a dagger

my life and dreams are shattered

and left in tyranny

Made an oracle against my will

Transfixed in the desert sands

Take a look at my once empty hand

See the rose that appears so real

Just like the one you saw in your dreams

They just feed their flames with miracles

From burden of grief and all I regret

Spare me the conscience before I forget

No place I can go

There's still a spark

There is no place in this room for the dark

So scatter the bones that's left of the old

For dust only settles when bored

Settles when bored

And trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,

And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself,

And you'll see me, somebody new,

Your perfect flesh impervious to anything fungal
You would sweat coconut milk and
I'd lie awake, restless with the heat during the night
Dawn would come and I would start to feel my own sunrise

But you'd just lie, sleeping



And so we went away in search of gentler breezes

When we arrived, I longed to lie and rustle in your grasses

But you would not permit me to retire there

None but a fly might settle on the meadow of your leg



Dawn would come and I would start to feel my own sunrise

But you'd just lie, sleeping



Then we moved on until we reached the tundra in the winter

Of course I longed to kiss her frosty teeth in the cold air

But now I've grown bloated on seal fat

Everyone that knew him knew which side that he'd be on
He never was a hero, or this county's shinin' light
But you could always find him standing up
For what he thought was right

He'd say you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything

You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string

Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name

You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything



Now we might have been better off or owned a bigger house

If Daddy had done more givin' in or a little more backing down

But we always had plenty just living his advice

Whatever you do today you'll have to sleep with tonight



He'd say you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything

You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string

Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name

You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything



Now I know that things are different than they were in Daddy's days

But I still believe what makes a man really hasn't changed



You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything

A new kind of strength for me
I feel a force I've never felt before

I don't want to fight it anymore

Feelings so strong can't be ignored

I burst out - I'm transformed



Rising up, shaking it off

The yesterday dreary

Graceful and strong, No more forlorn

Today's a jubilee

Don't be surprised

This change is my design



I feel a force I've never felt before

I don't want to fight it anymore

Feelings so strong can't be ignored

from the brave, the bold, the battered 

heart of Chevrolet:

It's coming from the sorrow in the street, 

the holy places where the races meet; 

from the homicidal bitchin'

where the women kneel to pray

Churning sea of Absu
Place of weeping death

Tiamat, dark serpent

Lord of the morbid priests

Enraged with hate for god

The priests of chaos chant

From the book of the worm

They burn the symbols of christ



We spit on the virgin lamb

And mock the words he spoke

His ways not worthy of me

We choose to burn in the pits of hell



Wreakers of death and havoc

Inflicting never ending pain

Sing the words of emptiness

Formulas of death

Call the queens of hell

And the god of the dead

The sea of Absu rolls

Rising spirit of Nar-Marratuk!!!



Bow down before the master

And pray the defeat of God Dog

Prayer of the ensnarers

Blind fiends of chaos rule



Rise up o powers of the sea

In the name of Absu I call

Come and carry my curse

To the ones who me disgust

May they burn in my cauldron

For they are as molten wax

So made it be



Liars in wait, priests of the night

Make images to burn by the moon

Robbing the spirit, raping god's law

Send up our hate to burn heavens gate",Rock,Metal,Morbid Angel,Abominations

To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled

And skeleton in cabinet

Buried deep under the water

You're resting on your laurels

And stepping on my toes



Whose side are you on?

What side is this anyways?

Put down your sword and crown

Come lay with me on the ground



You come beating like moth's wings

Spastic and violently

Whipping me into a storm

Shaking me down to the core



But you've run away from me

And you've left me shimmering

Like diamond wedding rings

Spinning dizzily down on the ground



But you're just like your father

Buried deep under the water

You're resting on your laurels

And stepping on my toes

TRABZKL128F931C0CE,Sea Wolf,Winter Windows,"There is a man inside a room in the forest
He sits alone upon the chair his father left him
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark with the radio on
The voice crackles when he says that God will save you
He will take you from the lonely life you're living

If you give, if you give, if you give up on what you want



The man stands and pours himself another bourbon

He stops and watches the birds through the winter windows

And the light, and the light from the morning dew



""I thought I love you and our love would be forever

How could I hit you, the only one who ever loved me?""

Said the man, said the man to his shadow



This is the world, this is the world we live in

It's not the one I choose, but it's the one we're given

This is the world, this is the world we live in

And it's the winter windows that ends become beginnings

Yep



As a boy, he was taught he was the bad one

One that could heed the other, the protector

He will walk, he will walk, he will walk into the river



Sixty years held down by his brother

Ten years with the ghost of his father

And five years since he spoke, since he spoke to his only son



This is the world, this is the world we live in

It's not the one I choose, but it's the one we're given

This is the world, this is the world we live in

And it's the winter windows that ends become beginnings

TRACAJY128F92CB794,Opera IX,The Prophecy,"My name is no-one and a thousand, but the old sages crowned me Queen Mother
I am the breath you can hear among the leaves of the trees
My sap emerges from the deep lakes flowing into the rivers and into the immense oceans
My blood, hot and violent, cleaves the grounding a blazing trail left by a fire dragon
Dark and deep is my womb where I generate any form of life
Here, the ancient learned to receive the old supreme art

I have created sprites and guardians, fools and sages to defend my original power

Hidden in a language written on stone shapes and symbols

Many where the children who worshipped my thousand faces with honour and respect

And I, good and terrible, fed them at my sacred springs with water and dragon's flash

Now I'm dying and so are all my faithful servants that men called Gods of Pagos

Now, the power of the only god hangs over me

And worse my fate will be if they forget about me

And with me the most ancient legend carried on by purest emotions will end

Follow the ancient path and don't turn to the false light

Raise your arms to heaven and you'll be protected

Let the spirit walk with your body and draw the cross in the circle

Abandon the sufferings that belong to your false nature

Love me and I will love you

Hate me and I will devour you

Descent into my crypts where the darkness of life reigns

And nourish the eternal sacred flame

Defend your brother tree and your sister stone because their lives are mine

Follow the snakes' trail

Because it will lead to me",Rock,Metal,Opera IX,The Prophecy

And it's deeper than Royal blue.

On the plain, on the foamy main,

And its conquest is complete.

The running of the foal!

The miner with his coal,

Do we lurk in the murk of the seas?

What then? Are we born again?

Just to sit asking questions like these?

And I'm sure each of you quite agrees:

The more it stays the same, the less it changes!

A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man's brain

But he can't be blamed

He's only a pawn in their game.



A South politician preaches to the poor white man,

""You got more than the blacks, don't complain.

You're better than them, you been born with white skin,"" they explain.

Is used it is plain

For the politician's gain

As he rises to fame

And the poor white remains

On the caboose of the train

But it ain't him to blame

He's only a pawn in their game.



The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,

And the marshals and cops get the same,

But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.

He's taught in his school

From the start by the rule

That the laws are with him

To protect his white skin

To keep up his hate

So he never thinks straight

'Bout the shape that he's in

But it ain't him to blame

He's only a pawn in their game.



From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks,

And the hoof beats pound in his brain.

And he's taught how to walk in a pack

Shoot in the back

With his fist in a clinch

To hang and to lynch

To hide 'neath the hood

To kill with no pain

Like a dog on a chain

He ain't got no name

But it ain't him to blame

He's only a pawn in their game.



Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.

They lowered him down as a king.

But when the shadowy sun sets on the one

That fired the gun

He'll see by his grave

On the stone that remains

Carved next to his name

His epitaph plain:

Only a pawn in their game.",Folk,,Bob Dylan,Only A Pawn In Their Game

Every night I dream a little dream;
And of course Prince Charming is the theme:
The he
For me.
Although I realize as well as you

It is seldom that a dream comes true,

To me it's clear

That he'll appear.



Some day he'll come along,

The man I love;

And he'll be big and strong,

The man I love;

And when he comes my way,

I'll do my best to make him stay.



He'll look at me and smile--

I'll understand;

And in a little while

He'll take my hand;

And though it seems absurd,

I know we both won't say a word.



Maybe I will meet him Sunday,

Maybe Monday -- maybe not;

Still I'm sure to meet him one day--

Maybe Tuesday

Will be my good news day.



He'll build a little home

Just meant for two;

From which I'll never roam--

Who would? Would you?

And so all else above,

I'm waiting for

Scared of what I have and haven't done

Why don't you stop measuring?

Will it be the death of me?

There is no doubt I need some help

How can I learn to protect me from myself?

Restraint is on the shelf

I just can't be alone with myself too long

Can't stop my trembling hands

Convinced myself the needle's

I'm sure if I wanted I could touch the sky

I'm already halfway there

But I'm falling down

Seems my time to fly is running out

Does anybody really care?



I've figured it out

There is no doubt I need some help

Can you try to save me from myself?



This craving is too strong

I've lost all self control

I just can't be alone

With myself anymore

I've nothing left to lose

And nothing stops the pain

But the poison

That I pump through my veins



And my tears they leave a stain

And my heart won't beat the strain

Cause the beast I just can't tame



I've figured it out

There is no doubt I need some help

Can I ever really trust myself?

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options

Is the opposite of progress Congress?

From the school to the street we're beyond stress

but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is

war is big biz, ask an economist

speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous

Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up

Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!

I want black and brown unity

but cats get out to bring the jail to the community

Fightin's nothin' new to me

I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me

Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:

We call it art, some call it a crime

it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine

on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1

Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned

the villain trained by the hero for the killing

now you twist $20 bills to see buildings

Under heavy surveillance

they might call you a traitor if you want something greater

Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live

just listen to the knowledge I give

if more than half the budget goes to military spending

less than half goes to whatever it's defending

One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties

and justice for all who are miserable

Ich bin 1,86 und wieg 72 Kilo! 

Ich trag 'ne Brille und rasier mich nicht oft! 

Ich wohn noch in nem Loch, doch bald in nem Loft! (Yeah)

Ich bin aus Westberlin! Ich musste letztens aus'm Wedding in's MV zieh'n!

Ja doch, so ziemlich alles! 

Im Sommer nicht soviel, wie wenn's im Winter kalt ist!

Ich sorg einfach dafür, dass die Welt immer bunt bleibt! 

(Ich hab gehört Aggro Berlin hat dich gesignt?) 

He, ja! Um mich zu kriegen haben die voll rumgeschleimt! 

Eine Million Vorschuss, doch der ist jetzt leer! 

Deswegen musste schnell mal ein Sido Album her!

Es klingt vielleicht seltsam, doch Ich will Geld hab'n!

TRACJGT12903CDE83E,Groove Coverage,Moonlight Shadow (Original Mix),"Verse 1
The last that ever she saw him, carried away by a moonlight shadown,
He passed on worried and warning, carried away by a moonlight shadown,
Lost in the riddle last Saturday night, far away on the other side,
he was caught in the middle of a desperate fight, and she couldn't find how to push through.



Verse 2



The trees that whisper in the evening, carried away by a moonlight shadown,

Sing the song of sorrow and grieving, carried away by a moonlight shadown,

All she saw was a silhouette of a gun, far away on the other side,

He was shot six times by a man on the run, and she couldn't find how to push through.



Verse 3



Four a.m. in the morning, carried away by a moonlight shadown,

I watched your vision forming, carried away by a moonlight shadown,

Star was glowin' in a silvery night, far away on the other side,

Will you come to talk to me this night, but she couldn't find how to push through.

Deathless sin
Led to the place of atonement
Repent through pain
Slicing off proof of guilt



Immortal lust

Blood craving torturers revel

Pain through penance

You will plead for your scourge



Burnt with iron

Retinas scorched

Eyes are blind

Purge the mind



Enter the chambers of blood

Slave to the cruelty inside

Die in the chambers of blood

Cleansed of the sins of your life...bleeding



Walls are stained with blood of vice

Learn through scourge

The errors of depravity



Immortal curse

Inquisitors for eternity

Scourging to learn

The stamina of the condemned



Disembowel

Torn apart

Heaving lungs

Severed tongues



Never to speak evil, never again

This is the way it must be

Burnt at the stake or

Stretched on the rack

Burning your soul

Draw out your guilt



Pieces torn off

Pieces that sinned

Tumors that must be destroyed

Chop off a cock or carve out a cunt

Cleansing your soul, bleed to atone



Enter the chambers of blood

Slave to the cruelty inside

Die in the chambers of blood

Cleansed of the sins of your life



Bleed on it's infernal walls

Nailed to the prison you made

Scraps of flesh litter the halls

Torture the price has been paid

She was sweeter than aspartame
Her kisses reconfigured my DNA
And after that I never was the same
And I loved her even more

Than Marlon Brando loved souffle

She was gorgeous, she was charming

Yeah, she was perfect in every way



Except she was always using the word ""infer""

When she obviously meant ""imply""

And I know some guys would put up with that kind of thing

But frankly, I can't imagine why



And I told her, I said

""Hey! Are we playing horseshoes, honey?

No, I don't think we are!

You're close! (Close!)

But no cigar!""



Then I met sweet young Janet

Prettiest thing on the planet

Had a body hotter than a habanjero

She had lips like a ripe pomegranate



And I was crazy like Manson about her

She got me all choked up like Momma Cass

She had a smile so incredibly radiant

You had to watch it through a piece of smoked glass



I thought after all these years of searching around

I'd found my soulmate finally

But one day I found OUT she actually owned a copy

Of Joe Dirt on DVD



Oh, no! I said

""Hey! Are we lobbing hand grenades, kiddo?

No I don't think we are!

And she was everything I've dreamed of

She moved right up to #1 on my list

And did I mention she's a world famous billionare

Bikini supermodel astrophysicist



Yeah, she was so pretty she made Charlize Theron

Look like a big fat slobbering pig

The only caveat is one of her earlobes

Was just a little tiny bit too big

Red sorrow's grinning through my veins

My garden whispers tunes

Hear my voice and drink my tears

I await you with firetunes

Veiled in everlasting silence

As we danced as one with the dryads of July

The harvester will sorrow reap

TRACJYX128F1453469,Hanson,Man From Milwaukee,"It started at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere
Sitting beside me was a man with no hair
From the look on his face and the size of his toes
He comes from a place that nobody knows
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating

Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky

Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating

If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why



I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee

He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie

He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky

He says they'll come get him, come get him some day



He says where he's from is called Albertane

There they use more than 10% of the brain

But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave

They run around in underwear and they never shave



Or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating

Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky

Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating

If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

This is Mother Bird calling Baby Bird

Baby Bird come in, come in Baby Bird



For the love of Pete come in!

This is Baby Bird...sorry I was watching Court TV

Do you copy? Do you copy?

Of course we copy...24 hours a day...in color



You wouldn't believe me if I told you the rest

The man sitting by me who was barely dressed

Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane

And left me at the bus stop just barely sane



I've been sitting here too long thinkin' about Milwaukee

I've been talking too long on my yellow walkie talkie

I'm talking to Mars you may think I'm wacky

And you still can't let go?
I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet

I was deceived by the wrapping



Got caught in your web

And I learned how to bleed

I was prey in your bed

And devoured completely



And it hurts my soul

Cause I can't let go

All these walls are caving in

I can't stop my suffering

I hate to show that I've lost control

Cause I, I keep going right back

To the one thing that I need to walk away from



I need to get away from ya

I need to walk away from ya

Get away, walk away, walk away



I should have known

I was used for amusement

Couldn't see through the smoke

It was all an illusion



Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)

But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper)

We both can seduce

but darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)



I'm about to break

I can't stop this ache

I'm addicted to your allure

and I'm fiendin' for a cure

Every step I take

Leads to one mistake

I keep going right back

To the one thing that I need...



I can't mend

This torn state I'm in

Getting nothing in return

What did I do to deserve

The pain of this slow burn

And everywhere I turn

I keep going right back

To the one thing that I need to walk away from



I need to get away from ya

I need to walk away from ya



Everytime I try to grasp for air

I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over

Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,

I let out a silent prayer

let it be over, over



Inside I'm screaming

Begging, pleading

No more



I don't know what to do

My heart has been bruised

So sad but it's true

Each beat reminds me of you



It hurts my soul

Cause I can't let go

All these walls are caving in

I can't stop my suffering

I hate to show that I've lost control

Cause I

I keep going right back

To the one thing that I need, Oh



I'm about to break

And I can't stop this ache

I'm addicted to your allure

And I'm fiendin' for a cure

Every step I take

Leads to one mistake

I keep going right back

To the one thing that I need, Oh



I can't mend

This torn state I'm in

Getting nothing in return

What did I do to deserve

The pain of this moment

And everywhere I turn

I keep going right back

To the one thing that I need to walk away from



I say...

I need to get away from ya

I need to walk away from ya

Get away, walk away, walk away



Only thing I need to do is walk away



I need to get away from ya

I need to walk away from ya

Get away, walk away, walk away

This disorder in creation of life

Vision of lost words rise
Black god to raise hate in veins of the apocalypse
Holocaust of this testament in perceived idea of doom

The left hand of darkness shall bring this final redemption

Conspiracy in the offerings shall ring in horns of requiem

The principle power of deception in tainting the idol's blood

Held in this testimony for the opening of revelation

Unleash the revenge

Bound in the inverted rites

Raise the great wargate in promise of the fallen ones

Adorned in rank through dark incantations, marching forth

Disfigure in abstract reason

Embrace the blind god

Suspension of this balance will break and fall

Be the sword of evil in dissecting of this praise of mercy

Monumental torture within the halls of the cleansed

Perverse in this exploration of a medium absorbed in fear

This lifeless blasphemy will assume the form of wrath

Desecration

An arousing repulsion to this spirited resistance

This desolate becoming

Supremacy

In attaining this oblivion

This force of hell

Great heavens will burn

Bastard in praise with tainted thought

Creation in death

Bound in nails

Great crown of razors

This truth bathed in lies

Fascination of the compelling terror that lies within dark hearts

Warning of the coming horsemen

You're the ocean

There's too much decision everywhere

There's too much decision everywhere

There's too much talk and not enough time

Let's close our eyes and not our minds



I'm fire-you're the ocean

I'm energy-you're the rhythm

Love is somewhere in between

What you believe and what you dream

I'm just trying to make you mine



You look for leads, I follow clues

You love to win, I dare to lose

Mostly you're a mind game in my head



You are earth, I am water

I can give you what you're after

You can be the word:I can be the rhyme:

There's really nothing you can do

You're going where I'm going too

Stay beside me, stay beside me

I want you



I'm fire-you're the ocean

I'm energy-you're the rhythm

Love is somewhere in between

What you believe and what you dream

I'm just trying to make you mine

un colpo che fa pieno centro!

Che mi resta di te, della tua poesia 

mentre l'ombra del sogno lenta scivola via

TRACMHD128F931FB14,Ensiferum,Hero In A Dream (Album Version),"A witch read from the palm of his hand
that his life would turn into darkness
and alone he would face all demons
from his past that he tries to forget
An elder king warned of the dangers
that lie in the valleys of north and

his only change was to find his shadow

so he had to set forth



He is the man who travels in the land

of dragons and magic spells

He rides in the winds of fire and snow

and he rules the forest of elves



Slash of the golden sword

a flash in the burning night

Curse of the evil lord

He is fighting for his life for the last time



Oh such beauty in time, but it's just external

He cannot see the truth with his eyes, so he is bound by a lie



The snow starts falling in paradise, as he gazes at the stars

He will be born again in the sky, when the night turns into a dawn



On the way to the ancient castle of time

he will soon be damned by rage

so that his pride could betray him

when it's time to set him free

The tears in his mind had to be pushed aside

as he walked through the gates

He will never die

'cause he is truly a Hero in a Dream",Metal,Rock,Ensiferum,Hero In A Dream

Had a good lookin' mama who never was around. 
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on an Indiana night. 
Well she moved down here at the age of eighteen, 

She blew the boys away; was more than they'd seen. 

I was introduced and we both started groovin' 

She said, I dig you, baby, but I got to keep movin' - on. 

Keep movin' on 



Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain. 

I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again. 



Well I don't know but I've been told, you never slow down, you never grow old. 

I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of goin' down, 

Tired of myself, tired of this town, 

Oh my, my, oh hell yes - Honey put on that party dress. 

Buy me a drink, sing me a song, 

Take me as I come . cause I can't stay long. 



Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain. 

I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again. 



There's pigeons down on Market Square, 

She's standing in her underwear. 

Lookin' down from a hotel room, 

Nightfall will be coming soon. 

Oh my, my, oh hell yes, you got to put on that party dress. 

It was too cold to cry, when I woke up alone. 

I hit my last number, I walked to the road. 



Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain. 

I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again.

To find fragments of resolution
The eyes of eternity

Focus on the myriad forms

As the minds of the conscious crumble

To the weakness their truth must conform



Fragments... of resolution

Fragments... of resolution



Breathing in this misery

Destroying absolution

Victim of a hidden past

Resounding with execution



Motionless are the serpent's eyes

Dripping with your conclusion

Hanging on by a thread of life

Ties are cut with resolution's... knife",Rock,Metal,Monstrosity,Fragments of Resolution

I'm aware I'm alive
All these places feel like home
With a name I'd never chosen
I can make my first steps

As a child of 25



This is the straw, final straw in the

Roof of my mouth as I lie to you

Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean

I didn't enjoy it at the time



You're the only thing that I love

It scares me more every day

On my knees I think clearer



Goodness I saw it coming

Or at least I'll claim I did

TRACQAV128F4270185,Beastie Boys,Paul Revere,"How here's a little story - I've got to tell
About three bad brothers - you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock, M.C.A., and me - Mike D.
Been had a little horsy named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer

Riding across the land - kicking up sand

Sheriff's posse on my tail cause I'm in demand

One lonely Beastie I be

All by myself - without nobody

The sun is beating down on my baseball hat

The air is gettin' hot - the beer is getting flat

Lookin' for a girl - I ran into a guy

His name is M.C.A., I said, ""Howdy"" - he said, ""Hi""



He told a little story - that sounded well rehearsed

Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst

The brew was in my hand - and he was on my tip

His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry - he asked me for a sip

He said, ""Can I get some?""

I said, ""You can't get none!""

Had a chance to run

He pulled out his shotgun

He was quick on the draw - I thought I'd be dead

He put the gun to my head and this is what he said,



""Now my name is M.C.A. - I've got a license to kill

I think you know what time it is - it's time to get ill

Now what do we have here - an outlaw and his beer

I run this land, you understand - I make myself clear.""

We stepped into the wind - he had a gun, I had a grin

You think this story's over but it's ready to begin



""Now I got the gun - you got the brew

You got two choices of what you can do

It's not a tough decision as you can see

I can blow you away or you can ride with me"" I said, I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border

The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter

I did it like this - I did it like that

I did it with a whiffleball bat

So I'm on the run - the cop's got my gun

And right about now - it's time to have some fun

The King Adrock - that is my name

And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.""

We rode for six hours the we hit the spot

The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot

This dude was staring like he knows who we are

We took the empty spot next to him at the bar

M.C.A. said, ""Yo, you know this kid?""

I said, ""I didn't."" - but I know he did

The kid said, ""Get ready cause this ain't funny

My name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money.""

Pulled out the jammy - aimed it at the sky

He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" - and let two fly

Hands went up and people hit the floor

He wasted two kids that ran for the door

""I'm Mike D. and I get respect

Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect""

M.C.A. was with it and he's my ace

So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face

The piano player's out - the music stopped

His boy had beef - and he got dropped

Mike D. grabbed the money - M.C.A. snatched the gold

I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold",Rock,,Paul Revere & The Raiders,The Great Airplane Strike

Stuffed sailor up with eyeball sun

And if by castle ship should stray

Will reveal a joyful face

Will shine again in grace

Though it's plain to see 

This world is heavenly 

Be God's glow

Let our spirits never die

I feel you are all my brothers

Together we'll cry happy tears 

See the nations turn their swords

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash

He did the monster mash

The monster mash

It was a graveyard smash

He did the mash

It caught on in a flash

He did the mash

He did the monster mash



From my laboratory in the castle east

To the master bedroom where the vampires feast

The ghouls all came from their humble abodes

To get a jolt from my electrodes



They did the mash

They did the monster mash

The monster mash

It was a graveyard smash

They did the mash

It caught on in a flash

They did the mash

They did the monster mash



The zombies were having fun

The party had just begun

The guests included Wolf Man

Dracula and his son



The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds

Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds

The coffin-bangers were about to arrive

With their vocal group, ""The Crypt-Kicker Five""



They played the mash

They played the monster mash

The monster mash

It was a graveyard smash

They played the mash

It caught on in a flash

They played the mash

They played the monster mash



Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring

Seems he was troubled by just one thing

He opened the lid and shook his fist

And said, ""Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?""



It's now the mash

It's now the monster mash

The monster mash

And it's a graveyard smash

It's now the mash

It's caught on in a flash

It's now the mash

It's now the monster mash



Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band

And my monster mash is the hit of the land

For you, the living, this mash was meant too

When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you



Then you can mash

Then you can monster mash

The monster mash

And do my graveyard smash

Then you can mash

You'll catch on in a flash

Then you can monster mash",Pop,Rock,"Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett",Monster Mash

Test, check. Well, he's been released today, and I'm going back where I started.
Looking over old notes, listening to tapes, wondering how bad I potentially messed up
this time. The wounds seem to be healing, and he seems to be getting along. But as I
appendage it, and I know he seems fine, But seems can be a very dangerous word,
especially in this business, it can be fatal.



Initial Diagnosis: Catatonic. and I know he's back there somewhere, but there's just

no response whatsoever, to any kind of set illness. We'll start him with medication

tomorrow, for sure.



This mans tragedy has made him a prisoner in his own body. And it's not just tragedy,

it's dementia, despair, its this hole i can see in each of his eyes. Where all the

events that happen in this cruel world just kind of fall through. It's loneliness in

it's most crippling form. The kind that no amount of love, or human contact, could ever

mend.



The patient was plagued by violent nightmares. Terrible, deeply troubling dreams.

Which one night overflowed in to reality, and he murdered his wife, in his sleep.

These people were in love, deeply in love. And it's that love that I can now see

behind his eyes. And it's my job to try and fill those holes with something else.

But what? Hope. I can try to fill those holes with drugs, soothing words, but

that's all. I hope those wounds will heal in time, but right now, things aren't

looking good.

Or the glamorous sky of blue
Maybe it was the mood I was in
Or maybe it was really you, really you

This heart of mine was doing very well

The world was fine as far as i could tell

And then quite suddenly i saw you, and i dreamed of gay amours

At dawn i wake up singing sentimental overtures



This heart of mine is gaily dancing now

I taste the wine of real romancing now

Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design

As long as life endures, it's yours, this heart of mine",Jazz,Country,Judy Garland & Gene Kelly,When You Wore a Tulip

I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade

The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five

But I am still alive.



I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide

And with the sea I did abide.

I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico

I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow

And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed

But I am living still.



I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide

Where steel and water did collide

A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado

I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below

They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound

But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and

around and around



I fly a starship across the Universe divide

And when I reach the other side

I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can

Perhaps I may become a highwayman again

Or I may simply be a single drop of rain

But I will remain

And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",Country,,Johnny Cash,Highwayman

Bring us your trinkets, your baubles of gold
Join the debauchery, the young and the old
Let us bow down to his great golden calf

Darken our spirits, as we dance and we laugh



The golden calf takes shape - the idol of black hearts

The whole deed, from the sum of its parts

From the healer of sorrow came a great molten blast

With holy tongue of fire, the commandments were cast



Down from the mountain with two tablets of stone

In countenanc white, Moses walked down alone

Instructed by God to bring the people His word

Intoxicated by evil, their judgment obscured

Why should we listen to his set of his rules ?

Deeper in sin sinks the assembly of fools



Though shalt not make graven images

Visiting evil in the land of the dust

Though shalt not have other gods before Me

Then only then can you truly be free



Let us bow down to the King of kings

Melt down this idol and the evil it brings",Metal,,Tourniquet,Melting The Golden Calf

His crimes are brought to the light of day

There'll be a price to pay

And I won't feel bad at all

When the hero takes a fall

Your mother told you stories

You substitute with girls who tell you more

Suddenly you sight a fancy chance

Since love is at your door.



We're seeing through you now

And I won't feel bad at all

Emotion is a virtue

For you, it is the one fatal flaw

Sitting on your throne and drinking,

Thinking she'll return your call.



Every story's got an ending

Look out! Here it comes, here it comes

And I won't feel bad at all

When the hero takes a fall

When the hero takes a fall

And I was thinkin' about you.
Here I am lookin' for signs of leaving,

You hold my hand, but do you really need me?

I guess it's time for me to let you go,

And I've been thinkin' about you,

I've been thinkin' about you.



When you sail across the ocean waters,

And you reach the other side safely,

Could you smile a little smile for me?

TRADCGE128F4270406,Johnny Paycheck,The Outlaw's Prayer,"You know, I worked the Big Packet show in Fort Worth, Saturday night, 
We had all day Sunday to rest and relax, before I caught another flight. 
So I decided to walk down town an' get myself a little fresh air. 
Before long, I found myself in front of a big church on the corner of the square. 
Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound. 

So I just walked up the steps an' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down. 

But before I could, a young man walked over to me an said: ""Excuse me, Sir, 

""But I can't let you in with that big black hat, those jeans, that beard an' long hair. 



So I just left, went back outside, sat down on that kerbing, an I thought to myself: 

That's the house of the Lord. That guy's got the hell of a nerve. 

Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please. 

So right there, in front of that Church, I just knelt down on my knees. 



I said: ""Lord, I know I don't look like much, but I didn't think you'd mind. 

""I just wanted to be with your people, Lord: it's been a long time. 

""A while ago, a saw a wino over there in the alley, all bent over in tears, 

""An' I thought how one stained glass window, from this Church, would feed his family for years."" 



""Then there's those fine cars parked outside: too many for me to count. 

""Made me think how people walked for days to hear your sermon on the mount. 

""Then there's those fine ladies in the choir, Lord, singin' like they really love it. 

""Hell, last night, they were dancin' on the front row of my show: drinkin' beer, screamin: 'Sing Shove It.' 



""You know, even John the Baptist wouldn't be welcome in this place, 

""With his coat made of Camel hair an' sandals on his feet an' a long beard on his face. 

""You know, Lord, when you come back to get your children, an' take 'em beyond the clouds, 

""To live forever in Heaven with you: well, I'd sure hate to be in this crowd. 



""You know, Lord, I'm not perfect; some even call me no count. 

""But I'll tell you: I believe a man is judged by what's in his heart, not what's in his bank account. 

""So if this is what religion is: a big car, a suit an' a tie, 

""Then I might as well forget it Lord, 'cause I can't qualify. 



""Oh, by the way, Lord, right before they kicked me out, didn't I see a picture of you? 

""With sandals an' a beard. Believe you had long hair too."" 

""Well, this is Paycheck, signing off. 

""I'll be seein' you Lord, I hope.""",Country,,Johnny Paycheck,The Outlaw's Prayer

Get big, little kid.



And I can't say why each day

doesn't quite fit the space

we saved for it.

But if that space now demands

that you throw up both your hands,

that you call it quits...



Take your midnight trip

I know you've dreamed of it.

Walk your sunset strip,

because I think you've needed it 

to get big, little kid.



But just remember that our love

only got this good

because of those younger days

that'd you like to outstrip.

So drink your cup down 

to the dregs and leave

that club shaking legs

with another guy,

but just remember: I'm not him.

C'mon what y'all want?



Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked

Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot

Cause it's all about sex, money, and murder

Fuck all y'all motherfuckin bitch ass niggas

I'm talkin to whoever wanna be ridin my dick

And you know your gon' get it as hot as I spit it

It's the Rule and nobody wanna be bothered with

If I hit 'em in every direction with four fifths

Will expend like 45's with compact discs (c'mon)

It's a disappointment to see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed

When I'm one of rap's anointed

Who else used to order it all on the dick

Like when I come through with spinners on the six

And got bitches bouncin like Ronnie in Tricks

But some whores in this game really don't make sense

Bomb roof and via Cal's and clonin Ems

But when bullets go through your film, we break your limbs

Cause I guess you can't see it, it's Murder again

Cause I don't love these hoes

I'm above and beyond everything that your seein

And I'm the only real nigga left rappin this freakin

The way I bang the heater out the back of the Hummer

The bull just move like runners from city block to city block

Layin down the foundation for what's really hot

Y'all niggas really not on my level (c'mon)

I'm like slugs when they pierce the metal, you see sparks (what)

My voice is a brush, they hear it it's like art

And nobody can really tell the twins apart

I call one Nina, other one Santa Maria

I might roll up on your set, dump and lean ya

My bitch is cocked to bang men in Virginia

Don't make me run up on ya, put a few in ya

Yeah, yeah, yo, Murder's outlaw, that guess I get a city's a broads

So I push the Porsche high and truck to court

Holla at the judge if the judge made a bad decision

I feel like the nigga that triggerin guns with mittens

It's hard to get done, I'm hearin that security runs

around 30K, if they don't get hit with an AK

And found out that the security's runnin another way

Like with me, it's Murder, probably

If I could drop in to manslaughter get a bail and flee

Cause my downess says bitch up, let her handle the pick up

Snow cone the country leave no market untouched

Call me drugs if this is how they pushin us rafters

But I don't do it cause I need it, I do it cause I want more

Definition is greed, I do it cause I want yours

And y'all niggas is teasin, y'all don't really want war

Walking to the bus stop
He's longing for his bed,
Waiting with his neighbours
In the rush hour queue

Got to get the first bus

So much for him to do.

He's got to hurry

Got to get his seat

Can't miss his place

Got to rest his feet.



Ten more minutes till he gets there

The crossword's nearly done.

It's been so hard these days

Not nearly so much fun.

His mind wanders to the office

His telephone, desk and chair

He's been happy with the company

They've treated him real fair.

Begin and end in 'C'

Like a big American car

But misspelt with a 'D'.

Let up enjoy your life

There's a meeting this morning

It's just his luck oh damn!

For his handkerchief.

Pearls of sweat on his collar

His pulse-beat seems so brief.

Eyes fall on his wristwatch

The seconds pass real slow

Gasping for the hot air

But the chest pain it won't go.

Tried to ask for help

But can't seem to speak a word,

Words are whispered frantically

But don't seem to be heard.

What about the wife and kids? 

They all depend on me!

So sling the coal, we'll make it, boy, or never ride no more.

While in the rear boxcar, a lonely hobo lay,

Heading for his mother dear, who on her death-bed lay;

He raised a weary hand, to brush away a tear,

Not knowing his last drive was run, and Fate was drawing near.



When through the darkened night, a headlight bright did gleam,

O'er the roar of rolling wheels, a whistle load did scream;

As down around the curve, the mighty train did roar,

With black smoke rolling from the stack, came Flyer Number Four.



Then came an awful crash! Their last long drive was run,

On the track the hobo lay, his days of life were done;

And as the golden sun, sank slowly to the west,

His dear old mother gently smiled, and closed her eyes in death.",Country,,Hank Snow,The Hobo's Last Ride

Starry skies of stains

She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign

But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds

It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?

And what we need to do in the game

TRADNRG128F4295A0E,Kris Kristofferson,Darby's Castle (Album Version),"See the ruin on the hill, where the smoke is hanging still,
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,

To provide her with material possessions.

And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.

And the building soon became his sole obsession.



Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,

And the silhouette was seen for miles around.

And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,

But it only took one night to bring it down,

When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.



Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,

In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.

For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,

And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.



Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,

And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.

And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,

Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.



Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,

And the silhouette was seen for miles around.

And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,

But it only took one night to bring it down,

Still got that look about you still got those things that we know
Red gilded place in the woods and the words that were said
Black twisted branches that hid all the things that we did
You threaded wasps on to string and you gave them to me

You touched the edges of their wings and the insides of me

All of the years make a picture that's faded and bright

All of the years make us different and faded and bright



Bring back the bodies and lay them out for me

Smooth down their crisp clear white wings in the morning

Bring back the yellow and black of the bodies

Lay them out slowly and string them up gently for me



Small piles of sticks built up like temples to time in the sun

Beds of green leaves laid out where fear and O negative burn

Strange to see you in a suit but your shoes are still red

Strange to see you at the front after all that you said



Your face changed a long time ago

But you're the same underneath this sleet

That whirls around like a line between worlds

And there are birds in here singing lullabies to me

About bodies and you and me and all that we've seen

And you and all that you've seen



Bring back the bodies and open them for me

Lift out their shimmering hearts in the morning

Bring back the yellow and black of the ocean

Let me out slowly and sing to me coldly

Bring back the yellow and black of the bodies

Let me in slowly and string me up sensitively",Folk,,Tunng,Bodies

He's a skitsofrantic, serial killer clown 
Who says, ""woman love his sexy smile"" 
Let's find out if his charm will work on Sharon 
Sharon, what's your question?"" 


""Contestant number one, 

I believe first impressions last forever 

So let's say you were to come over to my parent's house 

And have dinner with me and my family 

Tell me what you would do to make 

That first impression really stick"" 



Let's see, uh, well, I'd have to think about it 

I might show up in a tux, HA!, but I doubt it 

I'd probably just show up naked like I always do 

And lick your momma in the eye and tell her, ""FUCK YOU!!!"" 

Hurry up bitch, I'm hungry, I smell spaghetti 

I'd kick her in the butt and tell her, ""Get the food ready!"" 

Your dad will probably start tripping and get me pissed 

I'd have to walk up and bust him in his fucking lips! 

It's dinner time, we hearing grace from your mother 

I pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother 

I'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this 

You know for only 13, she got some big tits 

After that, your dad will try to jump again 

And only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin 

After you mom does the dishes and the silverware 

I'd dry-fuck her till I nut in my underwear 



""Now, let's me contestant number two 

He's a psychopathic, deranged, crackhead freak 

Who works for the Dark Carnival 

He says women call him stretch nuts 

Sharon, let's hear your question"" 



""I like a man who's not afraid to show his true emotions 

A man who expresses himself in his own special way 

Number two, if you fell in love with me 

Exactly how would you let me know?"" 



First thing, I could never love you 

You sound like a little richie-bitch, FUCK YOU!!! 

But if I did, I'd probably show you that I care 

By taking all these other motherfuckers outta here 

I'd go through your phone book and kill'em all 

And find contestant number one and break his fucking jaw (what?!) 

Anyone who looked at you, would have to pay 

I'd be blowing fucking nuggets off all day 

I'd tell ya that I love ya, if you don't say it back 

I'd have ta choke slam your neck and dislocate your back! 

I'd sing love songs to you, the best I can 

And then I'd club in your head like a CAVE MAN! 

When we go to the beach and walk through the sand 

I throw a little in your face and say, I'm just playin 

As you spit it all out, I'd rub your back 

And grab your underwear and wedge it up your ass crack!! 



""Well it sounds like contestant number two 

Is just over-flowing with sensativity, Sharon 

It's a touch choice so far 

Sharon, let's have your last question and 

See which one is going to win the rights to your neden"" 



""Okay, if we were at a dance club, and you both noticed me at the 

same time. Tell me, how would you each get my attention, and what would 

your pick up line be? Well, whoever's the smoothest wins!"" 



Okay, first I'd slide up to the bar 

And tell you that I can't believe how fuckin fat you are 

I'd tell that I like the way you make your titties shake 

And if you lost a little weight, you'd look like Rickie Lake! 



Fuck that, you'd be jocking me quick 

I'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick 

And then to get your attention in the crowded place 

I'd simply walk up and slap you in the fuckin face! 



Yeah, smack her in the mouth, yo, that'll get her 

Tell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better 

Look, fuck you, I got a strong rap 

Shit, you don't want contestant number two

You can work real hard or just fantasize

Couldn't you at least written me a good one



[Chorus]

She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwascht you too.

She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwascht you too.



Was it just a simple rewind and erase

Was your mind squeaky clean in the first place



If you gotta write an essay

do your research -- if you've got to

Stick your nose in a boy and girl fight

hear both sides first

There's something wrong being copied on a memo

in the form of a bad country demo



[Chorus]



Is there a funnel from her mind to your mouth now

Because you don't edit anything

It just comes out



I gotta say it's pretty gay

trading jabs in a pop song

So maybe next time 

e should just have a dance off

a dance off



Isn't there something in the bible

About forgiveness and love

and more importantly about throwing

stones and what your house is made of



You might reflect upon your own arrangement

94' getting blown in your basement



She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwascht you too

She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwascht you too.

she's brainwascht you - family

And your right is so wrong
Moral preached by immoral fucks

All I feel is despise

Lie no more you fucking cunts

You tare me up inside



Your sons die from your abuse

But you're giving us the blame

The easy path's the one you choose

That road will lead to pain

You're trying to control their mind

And strip them of free will

They way you force them to go blind

Will surely get them killed



My mind is free and so is my soul

You can't put me in chains

I won't play the well-adjusted role

Or bow my head in shame



So throw your stones of guilt at me

Point your finger, Curse my name!

Your scapegoat I will never be

I won't take the blame!



Now we're on trial to serve your crime

And pay for your mistakes

There is no way we'll do the time

The chains of lies will break

Censorship can't stop our truth

We speak straight from the heart

There is nothing you can do

We'll tare your souls apart



So see us rise we're few but strong

We'll crack your fucking teeth

And feed you with your twisted tongue

Until you cannot breathe



The fury makes our eyes see red

It burns within our hearts

Soon you'll all be stone cold dead

We'll tare your souls apart!",Rock,Metal,Amon Amarth,Bastards Of A Lying Breed

took a little time before the D-E-L could see through

and my man responded they would bomb a

fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules

the way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees

you need to take heed and quit being such a groupie

ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee

I neva saw a groupie like you

but what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew

but D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters

so I would suggest

that ya try to impress Uncle Fester

But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big.
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it
Was just a twig



Then the first snow came 

And she ran out to brush the snow away

So it wouldn't die

Came runnin' in all excited 

Slipped and almost hurt herself

And I laughed 'til I cried



She was always young at heart

Kinda dumb and kinda smart

And I loved her so

And I surprised her with a puppy

Kept me up all Christmas Eve

Two years ago



And it would sure embarass her

When I came in from workin' late

'Cause I would know

That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'

Over some sad and silly

Late, late show



And Honey I miss you

And I'm being good

And I'd love to be with you

If only I could



She wrecked the car and she was sad

And so afraid that I'd be mad

But what the heck

Though I pretended hard to be

Guess you could say she saw through me

And hugged my neck



I came home unexpectedly 

And caught her cryin' needlesly

In the middle of the day

And it was in the early Spring

When flowers bloom and Robins sing

She went away



And Honey I miss you

And I'm being good

And I'd love to be with you

If only I could



One day while I was not at home 

While she was there and all alone

The angels came

Now all I have is memories 

Of Honey and I wake up nights

And call her name



Now my life's an empty stage

Where Honey lived and Honey played

And love grew up

And a small cloud passes over head

And cries down on the flower bed

That Honey loved



And see the tree how big it's grown

But friend, it hasn't been too long

It wasn't big

I laughed at her and she got mad

The first day that she planted it 

Was just a twig",Rock,Country,Bobby Goldsboro,Honey

And is longer than before

And nothing really matters anymore

Stinging from the storm inside my ribs where it thunders

Nothing left to say or even really wonder



We're like a book

Every page is so torn

Nothing really matters anymore



It's so hard not to call you

Thunders in my bones

Out on the streets

Where I first saw you



Everything was new and colorful

It's gotten darker

Every day is a lesson things went right before

And nothing really matters anymore



It's so hard to be without you

Waiting for me when I wake some place on the pillow

And then I see the empty space beside me and remember

TRAEGKD12903CC9386,Artie Shaw,These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You),"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?

The ties that bound us

Are still around us

There's no escape that I can see

And still those little things remain

That bring me happiness or pain



A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces

An airline ticket to romantic places

And still my heart has wings

These foolish things remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant

A fair ground's painted swings

These foolish things remind me of you

You came you saw you conquer'd me

When you did that to me

I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

These foolish things remind me of you



First daffodils and long excited cables

And candle lights on little corner tables

And still my heart has wings

These foolish things remind me of you

The park at evening when the bell has sounded

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it

The beauty that is Spring's

These foolish things remind me of you

How strange how sweet to find you still

These things are dear to me

They seem to bring you near to me

The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

These foolish things remind me of you



Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

And still my heart has wings

These foolish things remind me of you

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes

The song that Crosby sings

These foolish things remind me of you

How strange how sweet to find you still

These things are dear to me

They seem to bring you near to me

The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

These foolish things remind me of you

Every move I make reminds me that I'll always love you
Since you were a child we built our lives around you
How am I supposed to live in this world we made without you?

Is that where you are? Are you a shooting star?

Can you say my name? Darling can you hear me?

Tell me where's your heart now that it stopped beating?

It's right here, it's right here, it's right here



When you joined the war we were so proud of you

You seemed so grown up, living life the way we taught you

Then your first letter came, it sounded nothing like you

It took all my strength to keep myself from running to you



Sometimes late at night I go the field

Is that where you are? Are you a shooting star?

Can you say my name? Darling can you hear me?

I would walk out with those kids, out across the sand

The voices of the canopy singers

Her age was 17
I gave her all I had to give,
but the baggage of my dreams
Stole me from the games we played
Scorned me for my mask

And if she's gone she lingers on

I beg you please don't ask

Twas on a dark March evening

South-bound I did ride

My head was out the window when

I found her at my side

Asked where I was goin' to

I told but where I came

For the jails in which Ive done my time

I fail hard to regain

Dark girl, dark girl it kills me so

to watch you so afraid

You know that you've been real to those

and realness should be paid

Her eyes gone wide, alive she cried

Does pleasure ever last?

We live to see, but patiently

I beg you please don't ask

She took me in despite my sins

Fed me tea and such

And as she fell just like a child

I crumbled 'neath her touch

I held my breath and appeared to weep

at the fragments of my brain

See each day's but a moment lad

I fail hard to regain

But as it goes the fiddler throws

Our values to the street

Whole world pain and sayings as gay as

Impatience in his field

And captives of this Wall Street trade

We curse our mortal tasks

Forgive us though we all must go

And where to please don't ask

And now I am a misspent man

Who knows not where he's been

And oh so sapped with sufferin'

The worst is yet unseen

Renounce myself for further wealth

I take each breath in vain

Still haunted by that railway girl

I fail hard to regain

Every time I'm put together I'm being destroyed
So when you come around

You'll find me on the ground

Searching for a piece that I've never found



I feel so stupid, friends knew it, turned to it



I'm by...myself, I'm bound...to be



I can't find what I'm missing

I've lost myself I hope that you're listening

I've seen my puzzle taken apart

It's hard to start again



But with you, all I knew was the filth that you put me through



I'm sick reliving the past

My time it came and it passed

I'm holding on to the memories, making them last

So when you come around

You'll find me on the ground

Searching for a piece that I've never found



And I knew it was to be

My words are quick to undress me

Filled my heart with broken glass

To make this thing last

Feels so numb when we lie together

Feels so numb when we lie together



I'm by...myself, I'm bound...to be",Rock,,Darwin's Waiting Room,Feel So Stupid (Table 9)

She is, too much,
Wish I could make her mine,

What a superlady,

a-ha, alright,

She's so fine,



Not long ago I was,

A sad and lonely boy,

Did not know how to get better,



Then heaven up above,

Sent me a super love,

And now I'm happy forever.



No one wants to believe,

I've got a perfect love,

They say I'm just talking crazy,



But I can prove it's true,

If you'l allow me to,

Tell you 'bout my Super Lady



She's all that I could explore,

She's more than a dream,

She's my everthing

Whoever thought I would,

Be feeling half this good,

The world for me is new place,



I'll drink to happiness,

Because our love's the best,

The wine for me has a new taste,



I'll let my lady know,

I'll never let her go,

Forever I'm gonna hold on,



She said she feel's the same,

Don't wanna play no game,

Just wants our love to live on and on,



Wish I could fly to the sky,

And write out her name,



Climb to the top of the world,

And loudly exclaim,

She's my everything

It's gonna feel real good, gonna make a difference 
Gonna make it right...

This wind is blowin' my mind 

I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat 

Who am I, to be blind? 

Pretending not to see their needs

And a one man's soul 

They follow each other on the wind ya' know

That's why I want you to know

I'm asking him to change his ways 

And no message could have been any clearer 

If you wanna make the world a better place 

Take a look at yourself, and then make a change 



(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah) 



I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love 

It's time that I realize 

That there are some with no home, not a nickle to loan 

Could it really be me, pretending that they're not alone? 



A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart 

And a washed-out dream 

(Washed out dream) 

They follow the pattern of the wind, ya' see 

'Cause they got no place to be

And the clouds all run away

And she brings a little sunshine

I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-

You say hello, little did I know...



That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-

And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-

And I was crying on the staircase-

begging you, ""Please don't go...""

And I said...



Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.

I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,

It's a love story, baby, just say yes.



So I sneak out to the garden to see you.

We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-

So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.

Oh, Oh.



Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,

And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -

but you were everything to me-

I was begging you, ""Please don't go""

And I said...



Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.

I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.

It's a love story, baby, just say yes-



Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.

This love is difficult, but it's real.

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.

It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Oh, Oh.



I got tired of waiting.

Wondering if you were ever coming around.

My faith in you was fading-

When I met you on the outskirts of town.

And I said...



Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.

I keep waiting, for you but you never come.

Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...



Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.

I love you, and that's all I really know.

Well I'd just roll my eyes and make a bee-line for the door
But I'd always wind up starry-eyed, cross-legged on the floor
Hanging on to every word

Man, the things I heard



It was harder times and longer days

Five miles to school, uphill both ways

We were cane switch raised, and dirt floor poor

'Course that was back before the war

Yeah, your uncle and I made quite a pair

Flying F-15's through hostile air

He went down but they missed me by a hair

He'd always stop right there and say...



That's something to be proud of

That's a life you can hang your hat on

That's a chin held high as the tears fall down

A gut sucked in, a chest stuck out

That's something to be proud of

But I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned 18

Cuz when you gotta fast car you think you've got everything

I learned quick those GTO's don't run on faith

I ended up broken down in some town north of L.A.

Working maximum hours for minimum wage

Well, I fell in love, next thing I know

The babies came, the car got slow

I sure do miss that old hot rod

But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs

Dad, I wonder if I ever let you down

If you're ashamed how I turned out

Well, he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow

Said, lemme tell ya right now



That's something to be proud of

That's a life you can hang your hat on

You don't need to make a million

Just be thankful to be workin'

If you're doing what you're able

And putting food there on the table

And providing for the family that you love

That's something to be proud of



And if all you ever really do is the best you can

Well, you did it man

Sit back and watch all the money roll in through a...

Stethoscope. Aerosol. Circulate. American. 

Common cold. Often told. Often tricked. Often fooled.

Outweighed the few

What's good for me and my family?

Breakneck. Break dance. Break down. 

There's laughter in the Whitehouse.

And the streets are alive with things you may not like

Like me. Like them. Disease. And pathogens. 

Blood born. Well warn. Wear gloves. 

When push comes. Don't shove. 

Just step aside and let the powerful men pass by

we have to fight or stars to fade

in the wind is our last farewells

There lived a humble family
Religious through and through.
But yay there was a black sheep
And he knew just what to do.

His name was young J.B. and he refused to step in-line.

A vision he did see-eth

Fuckin' rockin' all the time.

He wrote a tasty jam and all the planets did align



Oh the dragons balls were blazin' as I stepped into his cave,

Then I sliced his fuckin' cockles,

With a long and shiney blade!

'Twas I who fucked the dragon,

Fuckalize sing-fuckaloo!

And if you try to fuck with me,

Then I shall fuck you too!

Gotta get it on in the party zone!

I gots to shoot a load in the party zone!

Gotta lick a toad in the party zone!

Gotta suck a chode in the party zone!

[Crying]



You've disobeyed my orders, son,

Why were you ever born?

Your brother's ten times better than you,

Jesus loves him more.

This music that you play for us comes from the depths of hell.

Rock and roll's The Devil's work, he wants you to rebel.

You'll become a mindless puppet;

Beelzebub will pull the strings!

Your heart will lose direction,

And chaos it will bring.

You'd better shut your mouth,

Better watch your tone!

You're grounded for a week with no telephone!

Don't let me here you cry,

Don't let me hear you moan!

You gotta praise The Lord when you're in my home!



Dio can you hear me?

I am lost and so alone.

I'm askin' for your guidance.

Won't you come down from your throne?

I need a tight compadre who will teach me how to rock.

My father thinks you're evil,

But man, he can suck a cock.

Rock is not The Devil's work,

It's magical and rad.

I'll never rock as long as I am stuck here with my dad



I hear you brave young Jaybles,

You are hungry for the rock.

But to learn the ancient method,

Sacred doors you must unlock.

Escape your father's clutches,

And this oppressive neighborhood.

On a journey you must go,

To find the land of Hollywood!

In The City of Fallen Angels,

Where the ocean meets the sand,

You will form a strong alliance,

And the world's most awesome band.

To find your fame and fortune,

Through the valley you must walk.

You will face your inner demons.

Now go my son and rock!



So he went from fuckin' Kickapoo With hunger in his heart;

And he journeyed far and wide to find the secrets of his art;

But in the end he knew that he would find his counterpart.

Cold wind blows through a heart wired-in
Open skies he would explore
No there ain't no mastery
Of a passion and a deep blue love

Yearn to see far away places

One day he'd feel two hearts collide

In his eyes tears and desire

But he prays and he swears every night

One day scales will fall from her eyes



Just with a dream

Just with a dream and with a song

On my own I may stumble and fall

It don't matter at all when you're blessed with

Just what's yet to come, what's yet to come



When dogs run barking

And I don't hear no sound

And the sky is as blue

As eyes have never seen it

Then I remember

What I'd have been dying for

Faith rescue my dream

From a role that I've been put in

On their screen



Your eyes, and as I'll look into your eyes

We're at the crack of dawn

And destiny will know

It's just you and I

Far from the eye but close to heart

No matter how we try

Can't repel the counterpart

Our common bond we can't defy

When they were waiting for a sign

And they unlearned to face the silence

As they unlearned to turn inside



You're turning to the sky

And you're dying for an angel

If you want it bad enough, see those eyes

That's where two glances collide



Learn to breathe, learn to crawl

Learn to stand, walk and fall

Learn to lose and to love, to believe, to rise above

Love is more than to love



Burning feet on the ground

Got your head in the clouds

You're out to find Arcadia

And you know you will stand

You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

You're faking a smile with the coffee to go 

You tell me your life's been way off line 

You're falling to pieces everytime 

And I don't need no carryin' on

Just pass me by, I could see You

If I could rewind, I'd take back the lies

Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it

Cause they know that they don't spit the same

It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame

Everyday it's the same thing,

People in this game try to buddy buddy us

Just to get close enough to study us

Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that

It's like a monopoly

And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery 

And a damn slot machine at the same time as eachother

Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers

When we rhyme with eachother 

In time we discovered that we have more in common 

Then we thought with eachother

Both robbed of our mothers

Our fathers ain't want us

What was wrong with us, was it our fault

Cause we started thinkin god doesn't love us

Two odd motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time

What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens

I still remember the call up in ??

Big L had just got popped just a month before

If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia

Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate

That's when he popped up a number one

And we ain't never gonna stop if you wond-erin

Even if I'm under the gun 

You ain't gotta agree all the time with me

Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I

But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit 

Still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual

Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's

You'll feed him never lie

You show your kids the truth hope they never lie

In our endeavor we are never seeing eye to eye
No guts to sever so forever may we wave goodbye
And you're always telling me that it's my turn to move
When I wonder what could make the needle jump the groove

I won't fall for the oldest trick in the book

So don't sit there and think you're off of the hook

By saying there is no use changing 'cause



That's just what you are

That's just what you are



Acting steady always ready to defend your fears

What's the matter with the truth, did I offend your ears

By suggesting that a change might be a thing to try

Like it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guy

It's not like you would lose some critical piece

If somehow you moved point A to point B

Maintaining there is no point changing 'cause



That's just what you are

That's just what you are



Now I could talk to you till I'm blue in the face

But we still would arrive at the very same place

With you running around and me out of the race



So maybe you're right, nobody can take

Something older than time and hope you could make

It better, that would be a mistake

So take it just so far



'Cause that's just what you are

That's just what you are

That's just what you are



Acting steady always ready to defend your fears

What's the matter with the truth, did I offend your ears

Even when it is apparent where your actions will take you

Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise

But the heart rules the mind

And the going gets rough

Pride takes the fall

When you find that kind of love



I can't help feeling like a fool

Since I lost that place inside

Where my heart knew its way

And my soul was ever wise

Once innocence was lost

There was not faith enough

Still my heart held on

When it found that kind of love



Though beauty is rare enough

Still we trust

Somehow we'll find it there

With no guarantee

It seems to me

At least it should be fair



But if it's only tears and pain

Isn't it still worth the cost

Like some sweet saving grace

Or a river we must cross

If we don't understand

What this life is made of

We learn the truth

When we find that kind of love

Cause when innocence is lost

There is not faith enough

We learn the truth

When we find that kind of love",Country,,Alison Krauss,That Kind Of Love

here comes that sun again 
that means another day 
without you my friend 
And it hurts me 
to look into the mirror at myself 

and it hurts even more 

to have to be with somebody else 

and it's so hard to do 

and so easy to stay 

but sometimes 

sometimes you just have to walk away 

walk away 



With so many people 

to love in my life 

why do I worry 

about one 



But you put the happy 

in my ness 

you put the good times 

into my fun 

and it's so hard to do 

and so easy to stay 

but sometimes 

sometimes you just have to walk away 

walk away 

and head for the door 



We've tried the goodbye 

so many days 

we walk in the same direction 

so that we could never stray 

they say if you love somebody 

than you have got to set them free 

but I would rather be locked to you 

than live in this pain and misery 



They say time will 

make all this go away 

but it's time that has taken my tomorrows 

and turned them into yesterdays 

and once again you my friend 

are nowhere to be found 

and it's so hard to do 

and so easy to stay 

but sometimes 

sometimes you just have to walk away 

walk away 

and head for the door 

you just walk away

And tell a tale of springtime
Someone will call, hungry to spite me
Absent from luck and blame so slightly

Reveal a bite, skin tightening

Soon gone the thought, am I distracted

Follow me (Follow me)
Come with me to the dark side of the force (force)
No man would vote for your to this place
The devil only knows of this world

So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh

Soon as my flow starts

I compose art like the ghost of Mozart

Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't

Boy you think you're clever don't ya girl you think your so smart

Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so cold, a world where on-ly some will go

(Stay wide awake) But not return, when will they learn?

Where do they go? God only knows

(Stay wide awake)



[Verse 1:]

3-5-4-4

I think I smell the scent of a placenta

I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December

I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender

Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her

Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta

Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-

-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy widea

Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya

I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilda

Impregnate a lesbian, yea now let's see ya have triplets and I'll di-

-sintegrate them babies, as soon as they out hoe, with formalde-

-hyde in cyanide girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louda

No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun out of

Mur-derin I'd rather go 'vrinn-vrinn' and now you see just how the

Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalpa

Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull

Pull another one out uhhh



[Chorus]



[Verse 2:]

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me

There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me

But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my

It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry

She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me

So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?

Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep

And I creep right through the front seat

So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep

Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?

He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me

He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny

She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak

Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy

Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties

I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty

Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

But I'd tried to stay wide awake

Cause you might be found dead by the lake

Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take

Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?

I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away

Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?

Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets

How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya

Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there

I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya

Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya

Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower

Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars

Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da

Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta

Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya

Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water

Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand

Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe

Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that

What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

So no matter what is facing me

She has a way to give me strength

For her I'll wait a life but I can't go tonight

She makes the world a little better

The difference is

She makes it hurt a little lesser



The difference is

She can take away the pressure

You'll talk a little better

You'll eat a little better



You'll dress a little better

She lets the weight

Right off of my shoulders, shoulders, shoulders

And with this girl

I can picture growing older, older, older



And if you got one like mine

Better pull her closer, closer, closer

Don't play the cool guy, you'll lose your chance

To show her, show her, show her



Oh, this is the best of me

A hundred percent she expects from me

That's why I'm blessed with life to see her every night

And feel the touch, the touch of an angel

The difference is

She makes it hurt a little lesser



The difference is

She can take away the pressure

The closest thing to heaven

You'll talk a little better

You'll eat a little better



You'll dress a little better

Maybe I am the man with those mystic two heads
one facing down, the other facing back

and you still don't know who I am



Maybe I am the man with the legendary four hands

To finger, to heal, crave and strangulate

but I don't know who I am

TRAFAEO128F92E9A19,Run DMC,King of Rock,"I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct

Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect

Got the right to vote and will elect

And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect



They called us and said we're gettin iller

There's no one chiller

It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller

As one def rapper, I know I can hang

I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang

Roll to the rock, rock to the roll

DMC stands for devestating mic control

You can't touch me with a ten foot pole

And I even made the devil sell me his soul



Now we crash through walls, cut through floors

Bust through ceilings and knock down doors

And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box

You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks

For every living person we're a purple treat

It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?



Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool

I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule

It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool

It's all brand new, never ever old school



You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend

When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend

Music ain't nothin but a people's jam

It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band



Now I walked on ice and never fell

I spent my time in a plush hotel

I stood on many stages, held many mics

Take airplane flights, at huge heights

So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please

Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds

Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees

Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC



I am from, around the way

And Run goes to school, every day

And Jay plays the records he has to play

And we get down with no delay, HEY!

I rock the party with the words I speak

And Run says the rhymes that are unique

And Jay cuts the records every day of the week

And we are the crew that can never be beat

So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend

Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end

The rhymes we say, shall set a trend

Because a devestating rap is what we send



Every jam we play, we break two needles

There's three of us but we're not the Beatles

My name is Darryl, you can call him D

You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC

People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""

D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean



Like we said before, we rock hardcore

I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw

And now we got the knack, to attract

Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac

We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot

When it comes to rock, give it all we got

To be MC's, we got what it takes

Let the poppers pop and the breakers break

We're cool cool cats, it's like that

That's the way it is, so stay the hell back

We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's

Cause they don't make no songs like these

I don't make a sound. Splinters hit the ground. Silence screams so loud. As she leaves
As the torch loight shines. Trough the heavy skies. Autumn waves her hand straight at me. See her world fall down
As the trees turn brown. As she drifts away and leaves

As the lights go down. She won't leave this town with me



There's more endless days. Heaven slips away. And I still see her face in broken dreams. Works are left too late

In our last embrace. Pushed until she breaks just like me



As the lights go down. She won't leave this town. She won't leave this town with me



Things I wish she'd say. Just to hear something. Left alone to a fate that we don't yet see

Then the moment fades. The sun turns to slate. Nothing stays the same. She will leave



As the lights go down. She won't leave this town. As the lights go down. She won't leave this town.

As the lights go down. She won't leave this town with me",Rock,Folk,Newton Faulkner,This Town

Handed down from generation to generation

Well you seem to be waiting

For the thunder or the lightning

To blow away all your bad luck baby



Well you seem to be waiting

For a big landslide to take you away

But i don't think that a million bucks

Is really gonna change your luck

I'm here to tell you that's too high a price to pay



'cause it don't take much of the right thing

And if i stay by you

Don't worry about it

It don't take much for me to stay by you

And if i love you too much

Don't worry about it

It don't take much for me to love you



And they say that the world's gonna end with a whimper

Well that's just the sound it makes anyway

And i'm sure a bottle of some more million bucks

Would make it feel better

But believe it or not i think that's too high a price to pay

TRAFEEO12903CFEC87,Dark Fortress,The Silver Gate,"[Music: V Santura, Lyrics: Morean]
Awake, angels of lunacy,
Arise, avatars of chaos,
Incinerate yourselves,
In the blaze of Babylon,

Hierophants of the Hurricane,

We invoke the Eidolon.



Unleash the storm...



We renounce the sin,

Of mortal fallacy,

Bestow upon us,

Our stellar legacy.



Peel the benighted shells,

From our radiant cores,

We obey the laws,

Of finitude no more.



Ascend...

In Akasha to Procreate.

Strip the flesh from your soul,

Extend...

Open the Silver Gate...

Melt yourself beyond all control.



Give birth to the vision,

Let enter the voice,

And dare not falter,

Lest the demons eat you.

Confide in your Nuit,

Never your senses.



Nine apparitions,

The nails of Yod,

Drip from the moon

As unhallowed blood,

Anubis' terror to feed you,

As the night condenses.



Ascend...

In Akasha to Procreate.

Strip the flesh from your soul,

Extend...

Open the Silver Gate...

Melt yourself beyond all control.



In poisoned aberration,

Tarnished minion abide,

Convocating execrations,

To drown and smother, to divide.



Recline, Rejoice,

Discard the body,

And savour this, your threnody,

Divine by lust alone,

And second skin,

As the eyes turn to stone,

Let the heave begin!



Azazel!

Shemhazai!

Rejoin your kin in faith and fate!



Heed not the warnings,

We invoke the manyfold

Ny-Ar-Rut-Hotep

For we know,

There is no peace at the gate,

There is no peace at the gate...



Ascend,

In Akasha to procreate,

Strip the flesh from your soul,

Extend, open the Silver Gate,

Melt yourself beyond all control,

In Akasha to procreate,

Disembodied, unfettered souls,

Open the Silver Gate,

We embrace the stars

With twin black holes",Rock,Metal,Dark Fortress,The Silver Gate

So I found my guiding light

Lamp and flashing red and white

Through a starry night I'm better nowhere-bound

Than boundin on your solid ground

Its callin stars by name

A lonely song of freedom rings

In hope of someone listening and

So I send my feeble flare

Through the silent arctic air

Heading anywhere

Until at last i've finally found

A place to lay my anchor down

Are licking at their wounds

And knocking over garbage cans

With rodents and raccoons

From some old black and white

When the lights went off in Hogtown

The stars were shining bright



Oh, let the good times roll

From the Record Man 

Down to Cherry Road



Oh, let the good times roll

From Club Paradise

Down to Cherry Road



Now the old men have no shelf life

Down at the Polish Hall

They've fired up their flashlights

On a sleeping disco ball

Now the smart girls just got pretty

And they're not going home tonight

You better start talking before I go away

Instead build immunity and spread insight through community
These fundamentals, form the krux of longevity
When melodies are looped and vocals harmonize in unity
Now its 99 and aint a damn thing changed
Some seek fame as wealth manipulates the brain

Let me, paint this picture, your minds the canvas

Many claim their real and later flake like dandruff

Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words

The other 9 stick to my nikes and get rubbed out on the curb

Lets be real, we're paper chasin' for financial backing

But theres a thin line defined by need and greed many are passing

Known as crossing over for exposure some embark

Or cars,jewels and shit that wont exist when we depart

Crews, don't snooze, or eyes become bruised



This goes out to those that slept knew the deal or were confused..

Check the blueprint..



[Chorus]

So MC's, take it back to lyricism

Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm

DJ's pay bills develop skills

And respect the architecht as we begin to build

And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive

And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive

And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills..

[scratch]

So respect the architect as we begin to build



Clutchin my pen tight strugglin to portray the right depiction

I'm punchin the wall of writers block, loathing for recognition

Nowadays your not heard, unless your posing an image

With watered down lyrics that appeal to most who listen

Instead i'll water the roots so branches will replenish

Expanding elements that pioneers started building

Hiphop houses, so many free loading MC's

I feel theres only a few tenants who've been paying their fees

360 degrees what goes around comes back

I'm smoking mics as I inhale lies and exhale facts

Unfold the blueprints, the plans for improvement

Bridging gaps between the mind, ball point pen and the clueless

Innovation is useless once you forget the essence

So respect the architect. pick up your pens and start sketchin

Pick up your pens and start sketching..

So MC's, take it back to lyricism

Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm

And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive

And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive

And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills

[scratch]

So respect the architect as we begin to build



As I open my slanty eyes to this place called earth

I contemplate how music has lost artistic worth

And I'm shrivled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing

With bags under my eyes on account of too much sleeping

Because of these lies in rap that I can't feel

Leaving me dazed with the phrase ""i keep it real""

How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears

I'd rather be fed in the mouth, to shit it out from the rear

Claiming their underground but underwater their wrinkling

And me like water buoys to that level I'm never sinking

Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lispin'

Then when finished biting them, find your front teeth missing

I see em sippin fine wines in spas, to match their image

Gimmicks.. I flap my jaws and their squads diminished

I don't mess with glocks but metaphorically in speech

I'd like to pump em' with more shots than diabetics receive

Then in a better place may they peacefully rest

In hopes that next time the blueprints they'll manifest

Check the blueprint...

TRAFKII128F4291B06,Michael Nesmith,Two Different Roads,"You can't try and walk down two different roadsLook to both of them to bring you homeYou must take a wrong way, though it is the long wayAnd sometimes you find yourself aloneI know, for this all happened once beforeSometimes you think, ""I'll wait,""But he who hesitates is lostThis is not just a gameIt's the problem of creation, and only meditationCan make your mind and age the sameI know, for this all happened once beforeYou better move along, don't wait and let the dawnAnd its friendly sunrise catch you at restDo what you must, no man can criticize youAs long as what you're doing is your bestI know, for this all happened once beforeI know, for this all happened once before",Country,,Michael Nesmith,Two Different Roads
TRAFKIT12903CF3DA8,Art Blakey,Once In A While,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me

Though someone else may be

Nearer your heart?



Once in a while will you dream

Of the moments I shared with you

Moments before we two

Drifted apart?



In love's smoldering ember

One spark may remain

If love still can remember

That spark may burn again



I know that I'll be contented

With yesterday's memory

Knowing you think of me

Once in a while



In love's smoldering ember

One spark may remain

If love still can remember

The spark may burn again



I know that I'll be contented

With yesterday's memory

Knowing you think of me

Once in a while

With no thorn, AND no THISTLE 
Only AN open face 
Staring at the waking world 
Maybe she´s just a morning glory 

Lost in a tangle of vine 

Maybe she´s just a morning glory 

Lost in a tangle of vine 



Her arms stretch wide 

To receive a life 

And her ROOTS go deep into the BLACK EARTH for strength 

And she blooms and 



Maybe she´s just a morning glory 

Lost in a tangle of vine 

Maybe she´s just a morning glory 

Lost in a tangle of vine 



She blooms while the people sleep 

Only the TRAVELERS SEE HER 

To those who RISE with the noon day Sun 

She is a closed mystery 



AND Maybe she´s just a morning glory 

Lost in a tangle of vine 

OH, Maybe she´s just a morning glory

For a drink and a dollar

They keep staring at my tattoos

We all live with the scars we choose

They may hurt like hell

But they all make us stronger

always thought she'd stay
Now he's searching for the ring
the one she had to throw away
beach comber casts a shadow
long as his beard

never thought to cut it 

since his lover disappeared 

she left him in this crazy state he's in 

scouring the shoreline oh looking for the ring



oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger

she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer



there's a rhythm to his madness

a rhythm that he's in

retracing all the steps he walked

where once he was a king

his heart jolts awake 

to the beeps of his machine 

starts racing faster faster

till it's a steady stream

he riffles through every grain of sand

one for everything that slipped through his hands

and his friends have all gone

gone with the tide

and he's standing on the shoreline

stranded in time



oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger

she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer



beach combing for his lost gold

something to have and to hold

oh small fortunes they sat and stay

too long to wash away

sweat dripping from his head

like a bridal shower

and dampening the gleaming sand

but mixed with tears so sour



'cause he is just a dreamer 

she was just a dream

he is just a dreamer

she was just a dream



he is just a dreamer she is just a dream 

she is just a dream he is just a dreamer

My solo world in view
A glimpse beyond the world I know
An open door that I walk through?
And falling from the sky,

a tear before the rain.

But it will pass me by -

holding back again...



A man possessed wings to fly

beyond this space and time

The rhythm of this heart of mine

Is beating like a battle cry



And if I let it go

Will strength provide relief

from fearful winds that blow -

only disbelief



Tears falling

I'm calling

out into the air

My sun is rising where I stand - (I know)



One day I wake up

and suddenly I'm found

High flying man has been unbound (and so)



the hourglass is winding down

as all becomes so clear



now tears that fall are all around

and rainbows in the sky appear



Tears falling

I'm calling

out into the air

My sun is rising where I stand - (I know)

and suddenly I'm found

her taco is the destination

it wasn't for the dough

a genuine fiesta -

at the donkey show

the crowd would shout ""ole!""

as she nibbled on his sack

they never had a patron

demand their money back

the donkey's fucking my moms tits

acting like a true ranchero

dancing around a big sombrero

oh, boy, he loved to fuck

he'd get so damn excited

he'd kick and make you duck

if you want to be star

I was never in love, never had the time
In my hustle and hurry world

Laughing myself to sleep, waking up lonely

I needed someone to hold me, oh



It's such a crazy old town, it can bring you down

Till you run out of dreams

So you party all night to the music and lights

But you don't know what happiness means

I was dancin' in the dark with strangers

No love around me, when suddenly you found me, oh

Girl you're ev'ry woman in the world to me

You're my fantasy, you're my reality

Girl you're ev'ry woman in the world to me

You're ev'rything I need

You're ev'rything to me, oh girl



Ev'rything good, ev'rything fine

That's what you are

So put your hand in mine and together

We'll climb as high as the highest star

I'm living a lifetime in ev'ry minute that we're together

And I'm stayin' right here forever oh

You'd still be living in that dream

So for all the times you cried

And the many times he lied

I'll tell you 'cause I know

You can make it on your own



So your heart belongs to you now

And you know that it's right

Free from that make believe love story

In your mind (in your mind, in your mind)

Feel so much better, leaving yesterday behind

But always remember, hold on to life



So for all of your regrets

That your poor heart won't let you forget

I can tell you 'cause I know

You can make it on your own



You'll be wiser in the morning

So much stronger when the sun rises

So don't find your fear alarming

Your pain will disappear like nightfall

Will then rain comes, the pain goes

Wash it away

The remains of a battered soul

Trouble won't' last always

With the stars as her umbrella 

She asked me if I'd like to magnetise 

Do I have to go star-trekking

So I asked her for a number all the same 

She said, step in my transporter 

So I can teleport ya 

All around my heavenly body

Whatever..
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fuck it 
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..



I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag

of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be

the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth

And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works

And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve

all this tension dispensin these sentences

Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest

and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..

but at least have the decency in you

to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 

in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter

to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..

I don't know you and no, 

I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing

I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think

I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..

No patience is in me and if you offend me 

I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air 

I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit

I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe

I'm tired of all you (of all you)..

I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me



Chorus: Eminem



And I am, whatever you say I am

If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

In the paper, the news everyday I am

Radio won't even play my jam

Cause I am, whatever you say I am

If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

In the paper, the news everyday I am

I don't know it's just the way I am



[Eminem]

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered

with all of this nonsense it's constant

And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content -

- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""

And all of this controversy circles me

and it seems like the media immediately

points a finger at me (finger at me)..

So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie

or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up

when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up

with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too

When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school

and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin

Where were the parents at? And look where it's at

Middle America, now it's a tragedy

Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty

havin this happenin (this happenin)..

then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way)..

But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire 

to burn and it's burnin and I have returned



Chorus



[Eminem]

I'm so sick and tired of bein admired

that I wish that I would just die or get fired

and dropped from my label and stop with the fables

I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is..""

And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation

to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations

And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..

to deal with these cocky caucasians who think

I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk 

with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin 

the same fuckin questions (fuckin questions)..

What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in

The why, the who what when, the where, and the how

'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out

cause they drivin me crazy (drivin me crazy).. I can't take it 

I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for ev-ery fan that I get

But I can't take a SHIT, in the bathroom

without someone standin by it

No I won't sign your autograph

You can call me an asshole I'm glad

Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
