"Yeah, [x3]
I was right all along,
Yeah, [x3]
You come tagging along,
Exhibit A,
On a tray,

What you say,

Ends up thrown in your face,

Exhibit B,

What you see,

Well that's me,

I'll put you back in your place



Yeah I've done it before,

And I can do it some more,

So what you waiting for?

Yeah!

I was right all along!



[Chorus]



You know I've done it before,

And I can do it some more,

I've got my eye on the score,

I'm gonna cut through the floor,

It's too late,

It's too soon,

Or is it...



Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick...Boom!



Yeah, [x3]

I was right you were wrong,

Yeah, [x3]

Going, going you're gone!

I saw you yesterday, waiting too much,

Till it slipped through your hands,

And then you stagger to your feet and out the door,

Cos there's no second chance!



[Chorus]



Now you come crying to me...

But it's too late!

The man you're proud to be,

But it's too late!

Get your head out of the sand,

But it's too late...



It's too late,

Too late,

Too late,

Too late!



Yeah!

But it's too late! [x2]



Get your head out of the sand,

But it's too late!

It's too late,

It's too soon,

It's too late,

"Another day all alone again
Someone please love me
Another game; another broken heart
Why do I do this to myself
I could look can try to find someone
Who won't leave me lonely

But then I found I didn't need to search

Cause You were the one and You carried me



You fought for my heart and You have won it

You're taking me over and I like that

I tried other love but couldn't feel it

I'm so glad You found me because



I need You so close to me

(Cause You're the)

Only one that makes my life complete

(And Lord I)

Know it took so long to see that

You're my security

You won't go away from me

(And now I)

Know that I don't ever have to worry

Cause my heart feels so very free

You're my security



You are my security (There's no denying)

You are my security



Another day; here I go again

Drive myself insane

Stop to think; how could I forget

You're with me every single day

(Now I look)

And I see the One

The only one for me

Cause I don't need to search for

A way to try to be more

I have found a love that's so secure

You found for my heart and You have won it

You're taking me over and I like that

I tried other love but couldn't feel it

I'm so glad You found me because

Other relationships confuse me

The thought of Your simple love is crazy

You make me feel like no one has before



I need You so close to me

(Cause You're the)

Only one that makes my life complete

(And Lord I)

Know it took so long to see that

You're my security

You won't go away from me

(And now I)

Know that I don't ever have to worry

Cause my heart feels so very free

You're my security

"Hey

Your gold sation jacket and the silvery blues.

"I must've died and gone to heaven 
Cos it was a quarter past eleven 
On a Saturday in 1999 
Right across from where I'm standing 
On the dance floor she was landing 
It was clear that she was from another time 

Like some baby Barbarella 

With the stars as her umbrella 

She asked me if I'd like to magnetise 

Do I have to go star-trekking 

Cos it's you I should be checking 

So she lazer beamed me with her cosmic eyes 



She's just a cosmic girl 

From another galaxy 

My heart's at zero gravity 

She's from a cosmic world 

Putting me in ecstasy 

Transmitting on my frequency 

She's cosmic 



I'm scanning all my radars 

We'll she said she's from a quasar 

Forty thousand million light years away 

It's a distant solar system 

I tried to phone but they don't list 'em 

So I asked her for a number all the same 

She said, step in my transporter 

So I can teleport ya 

All around my heavenly body 

This could be a close encounter 

I should take care not to flounder 

Sends me into hyperspace, when I see her pretty face 



She's just a cosmic girl 

From another galaxy 

My heart's at zero gravity 

She's from a cosmic world 

Putting me in ecstasy 

Transmitting on my frequency 

She's cosmic 

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face 

Sends me into hyperspace when I see her pretty face... 



She's just a cosmic girl 

From another galaxy 

Transmitting on my frequency yeah cosmic, oh 

Can't you be my cosmic woman? 

I need you, I want you to be my cosmic girl

"Fivefold angles of Degrees
72 in number binding within
Inverted chaos
As spears impale wings
Shattered wholes, scattered remains

Corporeal ruin enstitched

Remnant altar

Worship made weapon in triptych



Occult machinery invoking

Warsouls bound to the penetrated inverse

Graven sigillum heralding flight

The path of Detonation



Obliterated faces, stone rooted in devotion

Measured in serration

From burning shells pours scorn



Breathless vessel, rabbiting heart

Blood flows up the temple steps

Ancient tongues shaping the cardinals

Blood is the altar

Ordinal denied



Howling vision

Unbending eye

Gates aligned

Seven wheeling on high



I am the spirit of the air

Swirling in burning atmosphere

From above I observe myself

Concupiscent to the Heavens

United with the archetype itself



Enthroned in self devourment

Rutting in rebirth

Gloria in excessvs

Deprivations

Writhing

"Remember when we held on in the rain.
The nights we almost lost it once again.
We can take the night into tomorrow. 
Living on feelings. 
Touching you I feel it all again.

Didn't we almost have it all. 

When love was all we had worth giving. 

The ride with you was worth the fall my friend. 

Loving you makes life worth living. 

Didn't we almost have it all. 

The nights we held on till the morning. 

You know you'll never love that way again. 

Didn't we almost have it all. 



The way you used to touch me felt so fine. 

We kept our hearts together down the line. 

A moment in the soul can last forever. 

Comfort and keep us. 

Help me bring the feeling back again. 



Didn't we almost have it all. 

When love was all we had worth giving. 

The ride with you was worth the fall my friend. 

Loving you makes life worth living. 

Didn't we almost have it all. 

The nights we held on till the morning. 

You know you'll never love that way again. 

Didn't we almost have it all. 



Didn't we have the best of times. 

When love was young and new. 

Couldn't we reach inside and find. 

That world of me and you. 

We'll never lose it again. 

Cause once you know what love is. 

You'll never let it end. 



Didn't we almost have it all. 

The nights we held on till the morning.

You know you'll never love that way again.

"Every step I take takes me farther from you
Every move I make reminds me that I'll always love you
Since you were a child we built our lives around you
How am I supposed to live in this world we made without you?
Sometimes late at night I go the field

Is that where you are? Are you a shooting star?

Can you say my name? Darling can you hear me?

Tell me where's your heart now that it stopped beating?

It's right here, it's right here, it's right here



When you joined the war we were so proud of you

You seemed so grown up, living life the way we taught you

Then your first letter came, it sounded nothing like you

It took all my strength to keep myself from running to you



Sometimes late at night I go the field

Is that where you are? Are you a shooting star?

Can you say my name? Darling can you hear me?

Tell me where's your heart now that it stopped beating?

It's right here, it's right here, it's right here



And it will always be until the sun dries the ocean

And you will always be my little one



If I was the President, if I was that man

I would walk out with those kids, out across the sand

If I was the President, if I was that brave

I would take a shovel then dig each child their grave

If I was the President and my world turned black

I would want no victory, I'd just want you back



I don't want no victory, I just want you back",Rock

When we walked in the sun
And we spoke with our eyes
Knowing what was to come
In the season of ice

When we walked in the sun

And talked in the sun

And we knew everything.



When we lived in a time

That's eluded us now

We try hard to return

But nobody knows how

When we lived in a time

And loved in a time

And we had everything.

Mmmmh, and we knew everything

Now the tables have turned

And the seasons have passed

We have wasted our lives

And strayed from the path

And we spoke with our eyes

Knowing what was to come

In the season of ice

When we walked in the sun

And talked in the sun

And everyday since then i'm slapped again

"This is the marriage of silence and love 
here is the temple where I come to learn 
here are the eternal little things that I always loved 
here are all my tears just waiting for my return. 
This the marriage of silence and love 

this is the land of the gentle soul 

here sometimes I met the man who can see what I see 

live what I dream and be the way he seems. 

And I have no doubt, here I fall and rise 

here I can be poor and feel so rich inside 

here I come back to me, here I come back to see 

what he's doing now, what he's doing now. 



Oh, I believe in the marriage of silence and love 

and I still need some patience to grasp it all 

I hope I won't forget these feelings fading off in time 

trapped behind my face, burning in my mind. 



Oh, I have no doubt, here I become wise 

here I can be poor and feel rich inside 

here I come back to me, here I come back to see 

what he's doing now, what he's doing now. 



At first, I've lost my direction and I was just glad to be alive 

but then, I had to meet myself and my depression and I, 

I should have swallowed all my pride 

and I know it now, yes I know it now 

and I want to know him now, 'cause I want to love him now. 



Still I have no doubt, here I live for now 

here I can be poor and feel so rich inside 

here I come back to me, here I come back to see 

what he's doing now, what he's doing now. 

here I come back to me, here I come back to see 

what he's doing now, what he's doing now.

"Hey these may be the final words
We may ever get to say
So let's not worry about small regrets

That shining light that leads me down

A path I'd been in search of former life

I never saw but should have known



Hey you melancholy clown

Tell me how the story ends

Will it become another tragic tale

or nothing left here to retent



An ironic twist of fate

A scary view so far away

Yet I search the gray tomorrow

And wonder where you've gone

Some things are better left unseen

"Always thought she'd stick around
always thought she'd stay
Now he's searching for the ring
the one she had to throw away
beach comber casts a shadow
long as his beard

never thought to cut it 

since his lover disappeared 

she left him in this crazy state he's in 

scouring the shoreline oh looking for the ring



oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger

she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer



there's a rhythm to his madness

a rhythm that he's in

retracing all the steps he walked

where once he was a king

his heart jolts awake 

to the beeps of his machine 

starts racing faster faster

till it's a steady stream

he riffles through every grain of sand

one for everything that slipped through his hands

and his friends have all gone

gone with the tide

and he's standing on the shoreline

stranded in time



oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger

she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer



beach combing for his lost gold

something to have and to hold

oh small fortunes they sat and stay

"My head is pounding my flesh's getting weak
I'm hiding my pleasures behind
Burnt out like a dead religion
My heart is aching as you crush my pride
I'm torn between love and hate
And victimized my soul

The sky turns grey as blood runs dry

So I did what I had to do

Refused to believe, only a precious lie

The will to survive, we embody the demise

There's no shelter for my sins

There's no way to leave behind

The fear to cross the line

There's no shadow as I pass

There's no mountain I must climb

Only the fear to cross the line

This is where my path leads me

I'm bonded and tied up like a slave

God may forgive or god may save

Devour the soul that's guilty

Sorrow turns to hate, you seal my fate

The thoughts of perfection enslaved

The truth remains to guide the way

These blessings won't take away

The presence of evil, the source of all fears

I swallow the pride that remains throughout the years",Rock
"I see trees of green
red roses too

I see sky of blue

and clouds of white

the dark secred night

and I think to myself

what a wonderful world



the coloured of the rainbow

so pretty in the sky

I also and the faces

by people passing by

I see friends shaking hands

saying how do you do?

there really saying I love you



I hear babies cry

they watch them grow

they learn much more

they 'll never know

"She grew up in a Indiana town, 
Had a good lookin' mama who never was around. 
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on an Indiana night. 
Well she moved down here at the age of eighteen, 

She blew the boys away; was more than they'd seen. 

I was introduced and we both started groovin' 

She said, I dig you, baby, but I got to keep movin' - on. 

Keep movin' on 



Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain. 

I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again. 



Well I don't know but I've been told, you never slow down, you never grow old. 

I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of goin' down, 

Tired of myself, tired of this town, 

Oh my, my, oh hell yes - Honey put on that party dress. 

Buy me a drink, sing me a song, 

Take me as I come . cause I can't stay long. 



Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain. 

I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again. 



There's pigeons down on Market Square, 

She's standing in her underwear. 

Lookin' down from a hotel room, 

Nightfall will be coming soon. 

Oh my, my, oh hell yes, you got to put on that party dress. 

It was too cold to cry, when I woke up alone. 

I hit my last number, I walked to the road.

"A lonely boy, a handful of dreams
Cold wind blows through a heart wired-in
Open skies he would explore
No there ain't no mastery
Of a passion and a deep blue love

Yearn to see far away places

One day he'd feel two hearts collide

In his eyes tears and desire

But he prays and he swears every night

One day scales will fall from her eyes



Just with a dream

Just with a dream and with a song

On my own I may stumble and fall

It don't matter at all when you're blessed with

Just what's yet to come, what's yet to come



When dogs run barking

And I don't hear no sound

And the sky is as blue

As eyes have never seen it

Then I remember

What I'd have been dying for

Faith rescue my dream

From a role that I've been put in

On their screen



Your eyes, and as I'll look into your eyes

We're at the crack of dawn

Life will stop telling lies

And destiny will know

It's just you and I



Burning feet on the ground

Got my head in the clouds

Journey to Arcadia

And I know I will stand

What I can't comprehend

Journey to Arcadia



The more we see we understand

That there's a lot that we don't know

As you awake on padded ground

The final curtain of the show



Far from the eye but close to heart

No matter how we try

Can't repel the counterpart

Our common bond we can't defy



I've seen them standing at the crossroads

When they were waiting for a sign

And they unlearned to face the silence

As they unlearned to turn inside



You're turning to the sky

And you're dying for an angel

If you want it bad enough, see those eyes

That's where two glances collide



Learn to breathe, learn to crawl

Learn to stand, walk and fall

Learn to lose and to love, to believe, to rise above

Love is more than to love



Burning feet on the ground

Got your head in the clouds

You're out to find Arcadia

And you know you will stand

What you can't comprehend

Journey to Arcadia



The more I've seen I understand

That there ain't nothing that I know now

As I awake on padded ground

The final curtain of the show",Rock

Nei tuoi occhi i gesti nascosti e poi.

Rami secchi e dietro i cancelli noi
L'innocenza è chiudere gli occhi e poi.

Prendi un po' di me

Respira più forte.



Facevamo un gioco da grandi noi.

Giocavamo a prendere il vento e poi.



Forse non lo sai che quei giorni non tornano più

Tornerà a cercarti ancora lì

Mentre insegui sogni che oggi non bastano più

Nei nostri luoghi e nei ricordi.



Quei segreti chiusi d'inverno e poi

Le paure, il tempo là fuori e noi.



Dammi un po' di te,

la parte più dolce,

prendi un po' di me,

respira più forte 



Che viviamo un giorno da grandi noi.

Sapevamo prendere il vento e poi.

"Well once I knew a railway girl
Her age was 17
I gave her all I had to give,
but the baggage of my dreams
Stole me from the games we played
Scorned me for my mask

And if she's gone she lingers on

I beg you please don't ask

Twas on a dark March evening

South-bound I did ride

My head was out the window when

I found her at my side

Asked where I was goin' to

I told but where I came

For the jails in which Ive done my time

I fail hard to regain

Dark girl, dark girl it kills me so

to watch you so afraid

You know that you've been real to those

and realness should be paid

Her eyes gone wide, alive she cried

Does pleasure ever last?

We live to see, but patiently

I beg you please don't ask

She took me in despite my sins

Fed me tea and such

And as she fell just like a child

I crumbled 'neath her touch

I held my breath and appeared to weep

at the fragments of my brain

See each day's but a moment lad

I fail hard to regain

But as it goes the fiddler throws

Our values to the street

Whole world pain and sayings as gay as

Impatience in his field

And captives of this Wall Street trade

We curse our mortal tasks

Forgive us though we all must go

And where to please don't ask

And now I am a misspent man

Who knows not where he's been

And oh so sapped with sufferin'

The worst is yet unseen

Renounce myself for further wealth

I take each breath in vain

Still haunted by that railway girl

I fail hard to regain

But then I found that it wasn't no place for me

Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit

Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit

They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role

Just because my equipment got stole

But I ain't goin out like no sucker-ass clown

They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down

So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-

Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother

Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game

You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same

Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin over

I really don't think I should have to explain

It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover

And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain

Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest

Because I got the 'Cpt' sign written across my chest

A funky dope brother never ceases to impress

My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest

I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly

Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively 

Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win 

Cause I'm a veteran from the C-o-m-p-t-o-n 

Kick it



(Born and raised)



Hell muthafuckin yeah

Funky dope for the nine-ace

DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin house

Yeah



(Born and raised in Compton)



Yo, check this shit out 

Right about now 

I'd like to send a shout out to my buddy Teddy Bear

What's up nigga?

What's up KK?

My buddy D

We got AMG most definitely in the house

What's up Pretty Greg and Big Baby Brian cold chillin

Talkin about the Armstrong Pack

This is not the last you've heard from me



I've felt the taste of poison

Water wet I breathe like air

I caused the earth to rumble

Some of you may recognize

My skills in lies and betrayal acts

The very same might find it strange

And it will be tomorrow before she comes back home

Get it crunk, get drunk and leave your house with somebody

True that, so homies don't bring your main misses 

Cause it's real deal mackin when it comes to the Chris's

And this could be your very last time seein her

One look at me and you better believe that I be g'n her

So come alone or don't come at all (why?)

Cause it's real big pimpin at this playa's ball

[SON OF THE GOD OF THUNDER]



As another flash struck to the ground

he recovered from his sleep.

So strong was his urge to test his might

but still he was too weak.



Who has no rites of passage undergone,

he cannot rule the thunder.

The first step is always to humble

and to learn the might of the gods.



Anger he felt, grabbed a thunderbolt

and across the heavens hate echoed!



An adolescent he is to ride a stormy cloud.

So young to carry the faintest bolt of lightning.

Alone he walks his path of honour.

Such skill wasted in lack of strength.



Too bold he was to learn - a grand punishment

deserved.



Anger he felt, grabbed a thunderbolt

and across the heavens hate echoed!



And lo, by disgrace he was expelled

from the clouds of his father.",Rock

Never sleep never eat

Carry burdens of their mommas' and the papas'

See the lust see the greed jealousy and killin'

All alone in the dark overtaken by this feelin' that I'm feelin'

Touch the hand that I've touched

Feel the pain of a grown man's death wish

Deep inside you must believe and you'll succeed

so they set out to destroy what punk had created
by dividing those involved
choosing cult names and hatred

the gutter press said punks should spit and fight

and the puppet punks were fooled alright

they began to sniff aerosol and tubes of glue

because the paper said that's what real punks do

like spitting on bands covering them in shit

even though they knew if they were playing, they wouldn't like it

the promoters wanted to put a stop

to the cheap gigs bands arranged on their own

so they introduced more lies and once the seeds were sown

the puppet punks began to smash up halls

believing they were having a real ball

but the destruction meant nothing at all

they were just dancing to the tunes

the big businessmen called

very soon bands couldn't afford to do their own gigs

and the promoters had won

they got their own way

protecting their halls with bouncers

they decided which bands could play

and best of all they controlled the price that we all have to pay

punk belongs to the punks

not the businessmen

they need us, we don't need them

punk will never be dead

as long as some of us refuse to be led

the rip-off merchants were quick to cash in

and the puppet punks parted with their hard earned cash

to buy the exploiter's rip-off trash

unable to see that these people only sell shit

as long as the people are willing to buy it",Punk

I've been waiting so very long for you to say it to me, say it to me

so please show me how to get these words

C'mon man - oh my fucking God man..
Oh shit, what the fuck did I do?
It's all my fucking fault man, it's all my fucking fault
Fuck man, fuck am I doing man, why man
Why God, why did you have to take her? Fuck..



[Sticky]

Why? Why? Why God why?

Everything I love always seems to die

Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you

Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you

Is there even a God? Do you even exist?

What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?

I'm talking to a God that I can't see

Can you see me? Can you see me?



[God]

Are you confused my son, and scared?

Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware



[Sticky]

Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me



[God]

It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?



[Sticky]

Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane



[God]

You are talking to yourself we are one of the same



[Sticky]

It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high

And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?

Is there life after death? What were we before birth?

Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?

Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?

Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?



[God]

Excuse me my son, one question at a time

We were never born, and we will never die

In the essence, there Is no such thing as death

How could I write commandments and not have them kept?

The soul is eternal you just change form

Then you come back with a new face on

You can not limit love unless you lack understanding

To answer you yes there is life in other planets

The futures a mystery the past is history

Today is a gift that's why it is called the present

Life is so simple unless you make it confusing

The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using



[Sticky]

Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you

God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you



[Chorus]

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?

If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?

If you could talk to God



[Sticky]

Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?



[God]

Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity



[Sticky]

I can't think I feel life going down the drain

In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain



[God]

Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts

Your feelings will really erase what you been taught

Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth

I speak through you to aware the youth



[Sticky]

But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?



[God]

In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite

How can there be left if there was never right?

How can something know death if it never knew life?

How can you lose, if nobody won?

How can it be dark if there was never a sun?

That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed

Form must exist for part of themself to manifest



[Sticky]

But I never asked to be born, I hate my life

And if you are God dammit then show me the light

And tell me- what's the meaning of life?



[God]

The process of all life

is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self



[Sticky]

Is God a he or she is there one true religion?



[God]

I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending

We are all one and everything is living

She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwascht you too.



Was it just a simple rewind and erase

Was your mind squeaky clean in the first place



If you gotta write an essay

do your research -- if you've got to

Stick your nose in a boy and girl fight

hear both sides first

There's something wrong being copied on a memo

in the form of a bad country demo



[Chorus]



Is there a funnel from her mind to your mouth now

Because you don't edit anything

It just comes out



I gotta say it's pretty gay

trading jabs in a pop song

So maybe next time 

e should just have a dance off

a dance off



Isn't there something in the bible

About forgiveness and love

and more importantly about throwing

stones and what your house is made of



You might reflect upon your own arrangement

94' getting blown in your basement

She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwascht you too.



She's brainwascht you - integrity

she's brainwascht you - family

You've ruled us for too long
Truth to you are lies to me
And your right is so wrong
Moral preached by immoral fucks

All I feel is despise

Lie no more you fucking cunts

You tare me up inside



Your sons die from your abuse

But you're giving us the blame

The easy path's the one you choose

That road will lead to pain

You're trying to control their mind

And strip them of free will

They way you force them to go blind

Will surely get them killed



My mind is free and so is my soul

You can't put me in chains

I won't play the well-adjusted role

Or bow my head in shame



So throw your stones of guilt at me

Point your finger, Curse my name!

Your scapegoat I will never be

I won't take the blame!



Now we're on trial to serve your crime

And pay for your mistakes

There is no way we'll do the time

The chains of lies will break

Censorship can't stop our truth

We speak straight from the heart

There is nothing you can do

We'll tare your souls apart



So see us rise we're few but strong

We'll crack your fucking teeth

And feed you with your twisted tongue

Until you cannot breathe



The fury makes our eyes see red

It burns within our hearts

Soon you'll all be stone cold dead

We'll tare your souls apart!",Rock

"Together we cry...
Together we cry...
Jenny was poor girl living in a rich world
Named her baby hope when he was just fourteen
She was hoping for a better world for this little girl

But the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree

Well she gets that call hope's too far gone

Her baby's on the way but nothing left inside

Together we cry!



What about the junk head could have gone the whole way

Lighting up the stage trying to get a deal

Now he's lighting up the wrong way

?something for the pain!?

Man you wanna see this kid he was so fuckin' unreal

When he gets that call he's too far gone

To get it together to sing one song hey won't hear tonight

The words of a lullaby



Together we cry...

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Together we cry...

Whoah oh whoah oh whoah

Together we cry...

Oh we cry we cry we cry

Together we cry.

Oh oh...



Oh...Mary's ambitious she wanna to be a politician

She been dreaming about it since she was a girl

She thought that she'd be the one to change the world

Always trying to pave the way for a woman in a... man's world

Life happened, house, kids, 2 cars, husband hits tha jar,

Cheques that don't go very far now

Now she in it can't change it, she keeps her mind on her wages

The only rattling cages!



Ohhh...

Together we cry

Together we cry



There's so much sad wanna flood the ocean

Were all in tears from the world exploding

Together we cry.

Oh we cry

Oh we cry...



There comes a time when every bird has to fly

At some point every rose has to die

It's hard to let your children go home

Where they go?

Who knows!

Getting drunk

Getting stoned

All alone

Teach a man to fish

You'll feed him never lie

You show your kids the truth hope they never lie

Instead of reading in a letter that they've gone to something better

?Bet your sorry now! I won't be coming home tonight?

I'm sick of looking for those heroes in the sky

To teach us how to fly

Together we cry



Together we cry...

Together we cry...

Waoooo

Yeahh...

So much sad wanna flood the ocean

Were all in tears from the world exploding

Together we cry...

Oh...

Yeah...

Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up

I walk in the club just to pipe it up

She was a basic bitch til I piped her up

I'm just doing my dab, I called it the pipe it up

They know that I'm having blue Benjamin's

They know I'm on top of the pyramid

They know I'ma go down in Guinness

All this dab a nigga drippin'

Piped up in the city

Piped up with yo bitches

Piped up in Givenchy

Piped up new edition

When a nigga start talking shit, gotta pipe up the ammunition

Your bitch walkin' around piped up

When she see me, she blowin' kisses

Feelin' like Aladdin, Quavo the genie

I grant your ho three wishes

You know I do magic, Quavo Houdini

I touch the pack and get it missin'

Broke niggas still saying ""turn it up!""

All my young rich niggas screaming out ""pipe it up!""

Benjamins old they extinct like a dinosaur

Look at yo diamonds, yo diamonds ain't bright enough

I send the work to get used in a catapult

Play with the dope in the snow like a hockey puck

Pipe it up, pipe it up, no Roddy Piper

They biting the flow nigga but the Migos got the title

So now niggas dabbing, don't know how it happen

I been touchdown on you niggas ask Madden

Don't forget bitch I'm the dab daddy

In stores now YRN fabric

Pipe it up, bitch it's gon' be the new anthem

I come through swervin in a black Panarama

Pull out the camo when you see me Christian Louboutin, hopping out that's an animal

Now remember, fore we made this song, nobody said pipe it up

Next thing we dropping, we gon' fuck em up, have everybody screaming pipe it up

Pipe it up in the club while I'm on drugs

A nigga fucking up the furniture

Shoot a money ball like Steve Kerr

Pipe it up, I get them pints on reserve



Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up

The blood drips like red inverted balloons
Tomorrow is a promise to no-one

It's not getting easier, it's not gettig easier

You can't even understand

It's not getting easier, it's not getting easier

And a mirror reflecting the truth

In your eyes, in your face you can't wash it away

From your cold, cold heart



I hope that you're folding stars",Rock
"I did not see the darkened sky
I did not feel the pressure drop
I walked down the primrose path
I strolled along the garden walk
The rain fell and washed away
I built on sand

I got swept away



I went out and stirred the air

(My soup was steeped in strange ideas)

I breathed in,

I breathed out

I breathed in,

I breathed out

The rain fell and washed away

I built on sand

I got swept away



I went out and looked around

I went out

And I came back!

I walked down the primrose path

I strolled along the garden walk

The rain fell and washed away

My bed of sand got swept away

I feel so solitary being in my home without you
I don't know what to do and

Just to be a simple man who sadly goes his way got no girl so

I got no world and

I got no words that I'll say

Hey hey woman make me happy like I've never known before

Say you have ever known no heart fore me anymore

Just waiting for the perfect view
I hope something special will step in to my life
Another fine edition of you
A pin-up done in shades of blue
Sometimes you find a yearning for the quiet life

The country air and all its joys

But badgers couldn't compensate at twice the price

For just another night with the boys oh yeah

And boys will be boys, will be boys

They say love's a gamble, hard to win, easy lose

And while sun shines you'd better make hay

So if life is your table and fate is the wheel

Then let the chips fall where they may

In modern times the modern way

And as I was drifting past the Lorelei

I heard those slinky sirens wail - whooo

So look out sailor when you hear them croon

You'll never been the same again oh no

Their crazy music drives you insane - this way

So love, leave me. do what you will

-Who knows what tomorrow might bring'

Learn from your mistakes is my only advice

And stay cool is still the main rule

Old money's better than new

"""Let's meet contestant number one 
He's a skitsofrantic, serial killer clown 
Who says, ""woman love his sexy smile"" 
Let's find out if his charm will work on Sharon 
Sharon, what's your question?"" 


""Contestant number one, 

I believe first impressions last forever 

So let's say you were to come over to my parent's house 

And have dinner with me and my family 

Tell me what you would do to make 

That first impression really stick"" 



Let's see, uh, well, I'd have to think about it 

I might show up in a tux, HA!, but I doubt it 

I'd probably just show up naked like I always do 

And lick your momma in the eye and tell her, ""FUCK YOU!!!"" 

Hurry up bitch, I'm hungry, I smell spaghetti 

I'd kick her in the butt and tell her, ""Get the food ready!"" 

Your dad will probably start tripping and get me pissed 

I'd have to walk up and bust him in his fucking lips! 

It's dinner time, we hearing grace from your mother 

I pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother 

I'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this 

You know for only 13, she got some big tits 

After that, your dad will try to jump again 

And only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin 

After you mom does the dishes and the silverware 

I'd dry-fuck her till I nut in my underwear 



""Now, let's me contestant number two 

He's a psychopathic, deranged, crackhead freak 

Who works for the Dark Carnival 

He says women call him stretch nuts 

Sharon, let's hear your question"" 



""I like a man who's not afraid to show his true emotions 

A man who expresses himself in his own special way 

Number two, if you fell in love with me 

Exactly how would you let me know?"" 



First thing, I could never love you 

You sound like a little richie-bitch, FUCK YOU!!! 

But if I did, I'd probably show you that I care 

By taking all these other motherfuckers outta here 

I'd go through your phone book and kill'em all 

And find contestant number one and break his fucking jaw (what?!) 

Anyone who looked at you, would have to pay 

I'd be blowing fucking nuggets off all day 

I'd tell ya that I love ya, if you don't say it back 

I'd have ta choke slam your neck and dislocate your back! 

I'd sing love songs to you, the best I can 

And then I'd club in your head like a CAVE MAN! 

When we go to the beach and walk through the sand 

I throw a little in your face and say, I'm just playin 

As you spit it all out, I'd rub your back 

And grab your underwear and wedge it up your ass crack!! 



""Well it sounds like contestant number two 

Is just over-flowing with sensativity, Sharon 

It's a touch choice so far 

Sharon, let's have your last question and 

See which one is going to win the rights to your neden"" 



""Okay, if we were at a dance club, and you both noticed me at the 

same time. Tell me, how would you each get my attention, and what would 

your pick up line be? Well, whoever's the smoothest wins!"" 



Okay, first I'd slide up to the bar 

And tell you that I can't believe how fuckin fat you are 

I'd tell that I like the way you make your titties shake 

And if you lost a little weight, you'd look like Rickie Lake! 



Fuck that, you'd be jocking me quick 

I'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick 

And then to get your attention in the crowded place 

I'd simply walk up and slap you in the fuckin face! 



Yeah, smack her in the mouth, yo, that'll get her 

Tell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better 

Look, fuck you, I got a strong rap 

Shit, you don't want contestant number two

I walk into a bar and there he was 

Standing up on a bucket, eww, trying to fuck it 

It was a big fucking smelly, ass farm llama

"I sit and concentrate, and try hard not to hate my enemies
I try to picture them dressed up as furry little bunnies
But when I look into their glass eyes

Cute little legs, hopping around and...



I think of dictators who were known to have been especial brutes

And I try to picture them gathered together in their bathing suits

But when I look down at their bodies

I can see they're warm and soft and pink



Standing around, standing on their two legs

Two little legs, standing around and...



I try to meditate, control my hate just like I know I should

But I can't help myself, and I keep it up because it feels so good

But when I look down at my belly

I can see it's pink and soft and weak

Two skinny legs, I'm kneeling down and...",Rock

Every space that we ever made

Just a thing to be kept and caged

Ooh, you take it all

Like the sea takes the land

From under my feet

Ooh, you take it all

Like the sea takes the land

Every fear that we ever chase

I don't know if you can

I want to take it too far

Come on don't be shy

I want to make you go down down



(Chorus)

I can make you scream

How I live my life when I have no choice

I see it in your eyes you're crazy

Just scream

How it feels inside

Let me hear your voice

And make it loud this time it opens up my mind



Tell me what you see

I'm not your enemy

If that's what you want to be

I don't know if I can

When you scream my name

And I take all the blame

It's never going to be the same

I don't know if you care

I want to take it too far come on don't be shy

I want to make you go down down



(Chorus)



When you scream

Maybe you're in denial

t kills me I can see it it's on your face

I can't see

Now we're breaking the silence

When you scream

Let it go and you take it away



(Chorus)



Maybe you're in denial

I can make you scream

I can see it it's on your face

When you scream

Now we're breaking the silence

I can make you scream

Let it go and ou take it away

"I'm standin' in the center of the room
I'm watchin' boys follow girls' perfume
Mmm
All is as it should be I assume
Ohh
Except for the distance between me and you



You're standin' as a flower on the wall

The room is still, but we're about to fall

And all the names that brought us here 

Simply fade away



Who you are is falling over me

(Who you are is falling over me)

Who you are is everything I need

(Who you are is everything I need)



I'm hoping

I'm waiting

I'm praying 

You are the one



And I'm hoping

I'm waiting

I'm praying 

You are the one



I can't believe that night turned into the day

I used the line you were supposed to say

Mmm, yeah

And all the names that brought us here

And now, we have to thank



Who you are is falling over me

(Who you are is falling over me)

And who you are is got me on my knees

(Who you are is got me on my knees)



I'm hoping

I'm waiting

I'm praying 

You are the one





If you are 

I will wait

I will follow

I'm here to stay

As long as we're promised tomorrow

I promise you today 

I'll wait

I'll wait



Who you are is falling over me

(Who you are is falling over me)

Who you are is got me on my knees

I'm praying 

You are the one

I'm waiting

I'm praying

"Eyeliner up, you knock me down
You hold your breath
And I hold mine
Every step, another step

Let us be happy while we're still young

Let us be happy while we're still young

From underneath the window seat

Yes, I like the stillness...



Sometimes we had endless hope

And tranquillizer eyes

Fear so close, it's hard to breathe

So close, but we believe

Let us be happy while we're still young

It's not the way it's supposed to be
It's just the way that it is
I'm afraid we are all victims here
And the one whose in charge
I've lead us all astray again

Are we too far gone?

We always assume the worst

I'm afraid no ones listening anymore

I'm freaking out

I'm so sick

I'm making me sick

Don't look down

The only thing in my way is myself

I'm just thinking out loud

How can I still be alive

I should've been gone so long ago

I can't get away from it all

I messed up like I always do

I gave you nothing

I took you nowhere

You're still listening

Has taken a turn for the worst

Should I jump should I stay

Can I make another day

Let them not depart from thy eyes
Keep them in the midst of thy heart
For they are life unto those that find them and health within all their flesh
Put away from thee a forward mouth and greet thine perverse lips

""I am the only God, worship me""



My sons, attend unto my wisdom and bow thine ear to my understanding

That thou mayest regard discretion and thy lips may keep knowledge as you know how to learn and keep silence



Hear me now therefore o ye children and depart not from my mouth

Come not nigh the door of my house if facility gives thee honour unto others



Incline thyself unto cruelty and walk the flesh which is consumed

Drink waters out of their cistern and let their rivers flows unto thy streets

Then thou may not regard my discretion and thy lips may not keep thy knowledge

"Rock`n`roll music just, let me hear some of that rock 'n' roll music

It's got a back beat, you can't lose it

Until it sounds just like a symphony

Them country folks they had a jamboree

They're drinkin' home, brew from a wooden cup

And started playin' that rock 'n' roll music

Don't care to hear 'em play the tango

I'm in no mood to dig a mambo

"Life lands a freshing blow. And once again our heart is broken. And as history repeats itself. These few words are sadly spoken. I've passed this way before. I've felt this pain before. A hurt that took so long to end. Has found my poor heart again. As I watch love walking away. It brings back old memories. But a familiar pain still feels the same. Once again, heartache has found me. A dark cloud covered my heart. Oh, when she told me goodbye. Now there's nothing left but emptiness. And the tears that filled my crying eyes. I've passed this way before. I've felt this pain before. A hurt that took so long to end. Has found my poor heart again. No matter how strong a man is. Without a love he walks in the dark, baby. If love deserts him it would surely hurt him. 'Cause his weakness is his heart. A lonely journey now stands before me. The endless pain has started. But this time I know the way. Walking alone and broken hearted. Because I've passed this way before. And I've felt this pain before. A hurt that took so long to end. Has found my poor heart again. I've passed this way before.

He fought a bout with Hammer Lane and took a tainted win

He was the hero of the Bowery, a prince of lawless times

Then was battered by the ""Butcherman"" in 1849

But no one knew the men who came and took his life one night

In 1842 they went a hundred and eighteen rounds

They begged McCoy to cash it in, he said that he would not

"The break of dawn brings forth, the tragic completion of rupture.
It feels as though nothing is what it seems, nightmares overwhelm my dreams.
Causing this, nauseating feeling inside my gut.
At night, cruel are these dreams which I envision throughout my mind.
As we lay intertwined here, enshrouded by the feeling of placidity.
Every aspect distinguishably as clear as could be, and I never felt more alive then when I dream of you.

The irony of it all leads to questioning, and thus brings on fear.

My thoughts clouded with uncertainty.

I am at battle with my inner demons.

I remember the contours of your lips, graciously pressed so tightly against mine.

Now, I'm left to wonder.

Uncertain these nightmares are in fact a dream.

While you slept I crept up to your room, careful not to make a sound.

I marvelled at such utter beauty, the unstableness maddening.

I carve through your abdomen, witnessing your eyes fade from brown to grey.

The surge brought me to my knees, as I permeate your chest plate, and now, feel the true meaning of having your heart ripped out, straight from your chest cavity.

Wither and die away already.",Metal

And I ain't taking the blame

In the unknown open country

It only speaks of everything before



Daughter you wear my name

Those are my eyes keep ’em raised

I may have scars but I give more than I take

Where you are far away

Lover are you gone

Ca vient de la rue 

Si ta fille rêve d'une vie comme Beyoncé 

Ca vient de la rue

Ca vient de la rue

Ca vient de la rue 

Science de la rime poussée à l'extrême 

Ca vient de la rue 

Mentalite je suis pas de ceux qui s'traînent, non 

Ca vient de la rue 

Et cette culture qui rassemble autant de jeunes 

Ca vient de la rue 

C'est subversif, censé, donc ca gêne 

Ca vient de la rue 

Ouai, les grands boxeurs, les joueurs phénomènes 

Ca vient de la rue 

Les femmes de ménage et leurs serpillères 

Ca vient de la rue 

Les pères courages que l'usine assasine 

Ca vient de la rue 

Et tout ce potentiel que l'on sous-estime 

Ca vient de la rue

"Do you think a girl should go to bed with a feller, if she doesn't love him? 
No. [pause] unless it's me.
I heard she drove the silvery sports-car /
Along the empty streets last night. /
Hanging around / with hair-dos like mine. /

No, I haven't seen the kids for some time. /



Picked up her shoes from the red-brick stairway, /

Just like a harpsichordist she moved. /

And back upstairs / at half past two, /

With a paper folded, outside the loo. /



Rain falls / like elvis tears. /

Oh no, / no sugar tonight. /

Out on the high street, / dim all the lights and /

Cry coloured tears again. /



And baby, / (don't forget to catch me.) /

Don't forget to catch me. / (don't forget to catch me.) /

On this platform with the drizzle in my eyes? /

"A witch read from the palm of his hand
that his life would turn into darkness
and alone he would face all demons
from his past that he tries to forget
An elder king warned of the dangers
that lie in the valleys of north and

his only change was to find his shadow

so he had to set forth



He is the man who travels in the land

of dragons and magic spells

He rides in the winds of fire and snow

and he rules the forest of elves



Slash of the golden sword

a flash in the burning night

Curse of the evil lord

He is fighting for his life for the last time



Oh such beauty in time, but it's just external

He cannot see the truth with his eyes, so he is bound by a lie



The snow starts falling in paradise, as he gazes at the stars

He will be born again in the sky, when the night turns into a dawn



On the way to the ancient castle of time

he will soon be damned by rage

so that his pride could betray him

when it's time to set him free

The tears in his mind had to be pushed aside

as he walked through the gates

He will never die

'cause he is truly a Hero in a Dream",Metal
"I'm gonna kick 'em out 
Well I feel pretty good 
And I guess that I could get crazy now, baby 
'Cause we all got in tune 
When the dressing room got hazy now, baby

Hot, sweet, and tight 

The girls can't stand it 

When you're doing it right When they're up on the stand 

And then they kick out the jams, yes 

Kick out the jams, I like to kick 'em out 



Yes I'm startin' to sweat 

You know my shirt's all wet 

What a feelin' 

And the sound that abounds and 

Resounds and rebounds off the ceiling 

You gotta have it, baby 

You can't do without 

When you get the feelin' 

You've got the sounds above 

Put that mic in my hand 

And let me kick out the jams 

Yes, kick out the jams, got to kick 'em out 



So you got to get it up 

And then can't get enough 

That's what .... 

'Cause it gets in your brain 

It drives you insane, makes you crazy 

The ...... the faster you funk 

If you wanna feed my rocket 

Till the morning comes 

Let me be who I am 

And let me kick out the jams

you really make me sick with ya fraudulent behavior
you're gonna make me flip and then an army couldn't save ya

why don't you behave ya little rugrat

take a little tip from the tabloid

because I know I'm not paranoid

when I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me

now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me

but it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes

you used to front big time now I suppose

that everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted

you used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it

so you gotta kick it with the homies

but D-E-L is already hip to your cronies

me and CM-PX thought about this and never have we seen a

brother who could look like Mista, Mista, Mistadobalina...

Ooooo, ooooo, mistadobalina

you thought ya could manipulate

you thought you could fool me

Ooooo, ooooo, mistadobalina

?_? put me on a stump and then he schooled me

friends can be fraudulent

just you wait and see

first he was my moneygrip

then he stole my honeydip

mistadobalina is a serpent

don't you agree

the little two-tima

resembles Aunt Jemima

with jeans and a dirty white hoodie

seems like he wouldn't be a snake

or would he

disguises come in all sizes and shapes

notice the facade of the snakes

they all catch the vapes

even though last year they was GQ

took a little time before the D-E-L could see through

the mask

all I had to do was ask ?_? and Kwame

and my man responded they would bomb a

fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules

the way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees

you need to take heed and quit being such a groupie

ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee

I neva saw a groupie like you

but what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew

but D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters

so I would suggest

that ya try to impress Uncle Fester

dobolina

because ya don't impress me

dobolina

the style of dress is not the key

dobolina

it's all in the mind and the heart

so you should start

by remembering ya gotta pay a fee

Why should we both fall apart

Let's fall to pieces together

From two hearts that just came undone

Why should we go crazy alone

Jingle jingle

We've go the lingo

With so much heat it's hard for us to pick the first single

It don't matter cuz I'm underground anyway

Rich balling, bitch call and fly any day

You dirty niggas y'all too whack to dance

Y'all need to ease up off that now before y'all splint y'all pants

And leave that up to my niggas, young fly niggas

Getting down you and I niggas dont try niggas

I changed my mind I don't want your bitch

Cuz sorry ass women just don't get rich

You could keep her

I'd rather have a fifi bag because it's cheaper

You can't come up for NL

I gets deeper

And my hold is so cold, it's a sleeper

So pass the reafer

And to you false balling niggas just grab your crotches

But if you paid nigga pat your pockets

And for sure

You've got yours

I've got mine's and we're balling

So call up everybody

Let's pitch in ona party for sure

Alright

Somebody play the potato

Let's take a ballad

On who gonna invite the hoes that make the party valid

Cuz we don't need a whole crib full of dudes again

And here come the police with them big black boots again

Kicking niggas out

Hand cuffing and stuffing they banging jacky chicken in they mouth

And time to shine pitching a fit

Cuz somebody rolled her bud in a heeny blunt and won't pass the shit

Who keeps turning the lights on?

Why the music keep skipping?

And why these dirty khaki niggas tripping?

I don't know I'm Quik and I'm still delighted

500 dollars worth of white star

About to hide it

Cuz y'all ain't drinking mine up

You better drink that anj and palmason and the rest of that wine up

You party haters need to stop it

I think we really about to pat your pockets

Hey baby

My girlfriend left me today

So which one of you old ragedy ass bitches wanna come in here and play?

That's what my homie told and try to cop the cancun

Then I caught him in there hunching in my downstairs bathroom

And in the kitchen and up in there on the dancefloor

By the big screen t.v. where your pants go?

Some of you niggas I swear

I try to throw y'all a ragedy ass party

And y'all don't even care

Cigarette burns in my plush

Empty beer bottles in the brush

And my bitch acting like a lush

Boy what else could go wrong?

Somebody kick the extension cord out

Shouldn't feel so far apart

You can't choose what you take

Why you gotta break and

Make it feel so hard

Like broken glass

Reflecting pieces of the sun

You're not the flame



You cut the people passing by

Because you know what you don't like

It's just so easy

Shouldn't feel so far apart

You can't choose

What you take

Why you gotta break and

Make it feel so hard



You draw so many lines in the sand

Lost the fingernails on your hands

How you gonna scratch any backs

Better hope the tide

Will take our lines away

Take all our lines and....



Hope the tide will take our lines a...

Hope the tide will take our lines away

"Sprinkle patterns in your daydreams, the world seems so much brighter
You've only seen them once or twice but you wonder what's inside them
Your dream could come true, you know, just test the water
Before you heave your boots and go, you better think this over

God bets you leave them, God bets you lie

God bets you never get another chance, God knows why

God bets you leave them, God bets you lie

God bets you never get another chance, God knows why



Your mind is full of ifs and maybes, you don't know which way to go

You're falling down and standing up but you're not going home



Your dream could come true, you know, just test the water

Before you heave your boots and go, you better



God bets you leave them, God bets you lie

God bets you never get another chance, God knows why



There's a place where everyone is difficult

It's a human downfall we are guilty of

It's the things inside us that are typical

God knows why

God knows why... you kill

Guess I failed to love you

She's all dressed up for glamour and rock and roll

Wanna squeeze her real tight get out of this place

If only I could take control



But she is out of my reach forever

And just a week ago she lied next to me

It's so ironic how I had to lose just 

To see that I failed to love you

And you're taking it out tonight

"Stop playing Jesus, Judas disguised, I know you fake it all the time.
One love to my love, One compromise, I know your blood tastes like wine.
And if I breathe in for you, can your heart shine through?
The only pain is to feel none at all.
And if we stay here tonight, under the moonlit sky, will we breathe in, or will our hearts just fade away?

Well you take away my oxygen.



Tonight we're loveless, help cries above.

We try to forget our love.

I let you down now, poisoned your lips, will this be our last kiss?



And if I breathe in for you, can your heart shine through?

The only pain is to feel none at all.

And if we stay here tonight, under the moonlit sky, will we breathe in, or will our hearts just fade away?

Well you take away my oxygen.

"Jillian was her name
She was sweeter than aspartame
Her kisses reconfigured my DNA
And after that I never was the same
And I loved her even more

Than Marlon Brando loved souffle

She was gorgeous, she was charming

Yeah, she was perfect in every way



Except she was always using the word ""infer""

When she obviously meant ""imply""

And I know some guys would put up with that kind of thing

But frankly, I can't imagine why



And I told her, I said

""Hey! Are we playing horseshoes, honey?

No, I don't think we are!

You're close! (Close!)

But no cigar!""



Then I met sweet young Janet

Prettiest thing on the planet

Had a body hotter than a habanjero

She had lips like a ripe pomegranate



And I was crazy like Manson about her

She got me all choked up like Momma Cass

She had a smile so incredibly radiant

You had to watch it through a piece of smoked glass



I thought after all these years of searching around

I'd found my soulmate finally

But one day I found OUT she actually owned a copy

Of Joe Dirt on DVD



Oh, no! I said

""Hey! Are we lobbing hand grenades, kiddo?

No I don't think we are!

You're close! (Close!)

Oh, so very close! (Close!)

Yeah, baby, you're close! (Close!)

She wore a ribbon on her left manolo

And she was everything I've dreamed of

She moved right up to #1 on my list

And did I mention she's a world famous billionare

Bikini supermodel astrophysicist



Yeah, she was so pretty she made Charlize Theron

Look like a big fat slobbering pig

The only caveat is one of her earlobes

Was just a little tiny bit too big

Flip our minds, drag us along
Leach on our morals, lead us to pain
Then rob us of all you can
Bludgeon the masses, with propaganda

Stealing our sons, stealing our lives

Hungry for power, to battle they go

Fire in their eyes, and rage in their souls



Den of thieves

Rule with greed

Steal our faith

Watch us bleed



Keep us in the dark and blind

Steal the thunder and the night

Steal the power and our might

Leave us only scraps to find

Take and take it all like swine

Take our lives then own the world

Leave the weak and burn what's left

Then let them starve among the ashes

Spreading lies, like the devil's plague

Make their crusade, our world's fate

Death in their eyes, now blood on their souls

Into the timeless dominion
Enter the realms of the unknown

Feel the immense pain as you die

Meeting resistance, I'm numb to the pain

Determined to travel, into this domain

My will is my strength, all resistance in vain

Through electric waves, injected to my brain



Worlds, artificial realities seen by my astral eyes

I behold a creation completely computerised

I successfully entered the core of this system

Feeling a strange fixation, I watch paralysed



Carnally lifeless, my mind fixed

Divided beings, in dormant states

Electric shockwaves, my body spasms

Deep hypnosis ending my voyaging in circuits

Off to the shore

Wandering soul

And heavy is the load

And you're about to fall into emptiness

Take away

Take me with thee and flee

Ache in my veins

Ache from the venom sweet

Forgive me my love

out in the ruins they seek shelter

golden days are gone, now I'm fighting to survive

The sword is on the street, it's kill or to be killed

on the wall, tell me what have we become

I know that this is going to take you down.

I am all you need to know.

The flags, they will blow.

The races are where the current will go.

The threat's underway.

The summer lit fades.

Ain't no stopping yo seniorita so tropi-co 

Cop a O and drop a flow

Cop a 4 with a 4-4 your undercover love go

From to Detroit to Chicago or wherever I go

I keep my blow tighter than the hair on your hoe

Under the cherry moon down in Cancun

I'm all about the boom 

Honeys know I'm about to hit the boom boom

Up in Cancun all about the boom
