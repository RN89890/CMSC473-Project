Country,"An old man was sitting at his table one day
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I coming to see her real soon I hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last

The postman was passing and picked up the note
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke
Straight up into heaven this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know",5.0,9.2

I never knew such bliss existed
Or maybe it's just so indescribable
Love was liable to get her twisted
She never told me but if she tried I was a little too young it floated right by me
I never dreamed love so fulfilling it's simply killing and over spilling on me
It goes on and on ... 

This ain't no ordinary love
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun

I refuse to believe we're a dying breed
Children of peace hope and harmony
Ordinary folks extraordinary love
Something from above
Something we fall short of
You can't see with an untrained eye 
But if you take a little time you are sure to find it
We complicate something so basic 
But once you taste it you gonna chase it like me

In our endeavor we are never seeing eye to eye
No guts to sever so forever may we wave goodbye
And you're always telling me that it's my turn to move
When I wonder what could make the needle jump the groove
I won't fall for the oldest trick in the book
So don't sit there and think you're off of the hook
By saying there is no use changing 'cause

That's just what you are
That's just what you are

Acting steady always ready to defend your fears
What's the matter with the truth, did I offend your ears
By suggesting that a change might be a thing to try
Like it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guy
It's not like you would lose some critical piece
If somehow you moved point A to point B
Maintaining there is no point changing 'cause

That's just what you are
That's just what you are

Now I could talk to you till I'm blue in the face
But we still would arrive at the very same place
With you running around and me out of the race

So maybe you're right, nobody can take
Something older than time and hope you could make
It better, that would be a mistake
So take it just so far

'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are

Acting steady always ready to defend your fears

Country,"One dark and stormy night while riding down the line;
Railroad Bill, the engineer said, ""Boy, we'll have to fly!""
We've got to be on time, to meet old Number Four.
So sling the coal, we'll make it, boy, or never ride no more.
While in the rear boxcar, a lonely hobo lay,
Heading for his mother dear, who on her death-bed lay;
He raised a weary hand, to brush away a tear,
Not knowing his last drive was run, and Fate was drawing near.

When through the darkened night, a headlight bright did gleam,
O'er the roar of rolling wheels, a whistle load did scream;
As down around the curve, the mighty train did roar,
With black smoke rolling from the stack, came Flyer Number Four.

Then came an awful crash! Their last long drive was run,
On the track the hobo lay, his days of life were done;
And as the golden sun, sank slowly to the west,
His dear old mother gently smiled, and closed her eyes in death.",5.333333333333333,10.75
Country,"(Tony Joe White)
Before you go and walk out on me
Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.
And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.",3.5714285714285716,8.76

Down below the cars in the city go rushing by,
I see it here alone and I wonder why,
Friday night and everyone's moving.
I can feel the heat but its soothing heading down,
I search for the beat in this dirty town,

Downtown the young ones are going,
Downtown the young ones are growing,

We're the kids in America,
We're the kids in America,
Everybody live for the music around,

Bright Lights,
The music gets faster,
Look boy don't check on your watch, Not another glance,
I'm not leaving now honey not a chance,
Hot shot give me no problems,
Much later baby you'll be, saying ""nevermind,""
You know life is cruel,
Life is never kind,

Kind hearts don't make a new story,
Kind hearts don't grab any glory,

We're the kids in America,
We're the kids in America,
Everybody live for the music around,

Come closer honey thats better,
Gotta get a brand new experience feeling right,
Oh, don't try to stop baby hold me tight,
Outside a new day is dawning,
Outside suburbia calling, everywhere,
I don't want to go baby,
New York to East California,
There's a new way come in on ya,

Siguiendo la ruta
De un pájaro herido.
Procuro alejarme
De aquellos lugares
Donde nos quisimos.
Me enredo en amores
Sin ganas ni fuerzas por ver si te
Olvido
Y llega la noche y de nuevo
Comprendo
Que te nenecito.

Procuro olvidarte
Haciendo en el día
Mil cosas distintas
Procuro olvidarte

Pisando y contando
Las hojas caidas
Procuro cansarme
Llegar a la noche apenas sin vida
Y al ver nuestra casa tan sola y callada

Lo que haría, por no sentirme así,
Por no vivir así perdido",6.5,4.0

This isn't slowing down.
We've hit black ice and lost control.
We're spinning faster now.
Tell me are we flying? Are we falling to the ground?
If tomorrow doesn't come, did we die for nothing?

Recounting past events has helped reveal that you don't give a damn 
about the days when you would live the words you wrote.
Not the person who you were; I hate the person you've become.
You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing.

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

You said you started up this home 
because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run.
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.
If you had then where were you?
We've payed our dues without you.

Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?
Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through.
I am nothing like you!

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.

This is the last time you will have us.
You're lawless and purely dishonest.
A scandal that we have funded for you.
Make no mistake this all is about you.

But I can't stop feeling love for this place we both came from. 
I will never lose my youth.
All of this is too unforgettable.

Talking to him but she ain't hearing a thing
If you were smart you'd turn around and let her go

She's real good-looking but she's got no heart at all

She puts on her makeup and drives to the bar in her

She does whatever she wants I guess
Whatever comes first or whatever looks best

Country,"(Michael McDonald)
Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love

I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love

Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair

But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost

There is not faith enough

Hey nah nah
Comenzaré yo a relatarles esta historia y no es de hadas
Leyenda que contaba chulo viejo de barrio en barrio
Boca a Boca, en la calzada
A los oídos del curioso rellenaba

Ah había una vez, una pareja desprovista poca vista sin dinero
Pensando atónito, tónico, crónico como vivir
Salir del negro fango que le ahogaba
Tramaban, andaban, entre besos una cámara silente
Para un estúpido tupido cliente
Que de vivo mira el punto de las daba
Estaba, andaba vigilando a la criolla de carnada

Pasó que en la guajira mira
Era más bruta que una mula lomo arriba

Vengo yo de tal manera

Que que que esta historia echa candela
Te la voy a hacer bien breve
Para que no te me aceleres
Oíste asere, todo lo que ella pedía
el punto la complacía y escucha lo que le decía

Todo lo que le pedía

Buy now, I kill for a living
I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock
This is what you have been billed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score
This is what you have been killed for
Dancing on the kill floor

Contrast bohemia to my workplace
When I'm racing in carpool lane
to sell shit to an art school lame
-Don't you think you're hot shit
Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number

You pasty Brits
Buy now
You crazy chicks

Cuz I don't pay attention to rules,
regulations or safety tips
Love us
Eligible bachelors
Love us
Cuz we're the Blowed rappers
Loved
Cuz I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars

Sitting beside me was a man with no hair
From the look on his face and the size of his toes
He comes from a place that nobody knows
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee
He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie
He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky
He says they'll come get him, come get him some day

He says where he's from is called Albertane
There they use more than 10% of the brain
But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave
They run around in underwear and they never shave

Or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating

Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane
And left me at the bus stop just barely sane

Is it possible, conceiveable that I sleepwalked out of my apartment
And went berzerk?""

In slipped rhythm
Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment
Parked in front the fan
And reminesce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand
'Tesants get the New York home game
With real life shoot-em-up action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art
Free game piece all included
I told this cat the earth was flat
He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
Brick-a-back novelty
Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed Tequilla worm future, be concerned
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the sand
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reaks of subway metal
Feather lecture journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with voices
Benefit to break room
Mummified manequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This a Malcom circus, got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you SUCKA!
I lay the Lord down upon its belly
With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk
Yelling 'Break yo'self!'
I'm the actualized data commission past penny tip jar donation
Been arranged, made by the farfetch from stability 
Took a heart pledge early on
Bled onto the drum doser
Plow in the metronome, home 
Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster
Sensation'll leave siesomgraph stabbin away on stone tablets
To sketch up out your future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
But have canceled developed, courtesy America
Land of the free base
Home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker
It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed
With dilapadated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece
A sweat a bit to make my Wookie ends meet
Pascifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate
Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit apparently
Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me'
Ok, time to buckle the fuck down 
Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You can catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process
Hence, your plight botches

I didn't even cause all that destruction

Are secret spies, as the tension grows
Deep down inside, I know they're coming for me
For the 2nd time, I'm going, going away
Why am I caught in this conspiracy
Have to find a way
Don't care what it takes
I shall persevere
Tell me why it is this way

Confused in this maze, no chance to escape

Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love

I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love

Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair

But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost

Rap,"[Intro:]
Yep
Follow me (Follow me)
Come with me to the dark side of the force (force)
No man would vote for your to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh

[Chorus:]
Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya girl you think your so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
(Stay wide awake) A world so cold, a world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake) But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

[Verse 1:]
3-5-4-4
I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta
Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-
-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy widea
Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya
I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilda
Impregnate a lesbian, yea now let's see ya have triplets and I'll di-
-sintegrate them babies, as soon as they out hoe, with formalde-
-hyde in cyanide girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louda
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun out of
Mur-derin I'd rather go 'vrinn-vrinn' and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalpa
Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull
Pull another one out uhhh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my
It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep
Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
But I'd tried to stay wide awake
Cause you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?
Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da
Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta
Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water
Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand
Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that
What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

Gonna tell everyone up under the sun

I refuse to believe we're a dying breed

Something we fall short of

But if you take a little time you are sure to find it
We complicate something so basic 
But once you taste it you gonna chase it like me

Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words
The other 9 stick to my nikes and get rubbed out on the curb
Lets be real, we're paper chasin' for financial backing
But theres a thin line defined by need and greed many are passing
Known as crossing over for exposure some embark
Or cars,jewels and shit that wont exist when we depart
Crews, don't snooze, or eyes become bruised

This goes out to those that slept knew the deal or were confused..
Check the blueprint..

[Chorus]
So MC's, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm
DJ's pay bills develop skills
And respect the architecht as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills..
[scratch]
So respect the architect as we begin to build

Clutchin my pen tight strugglin to portray the right depiction
I'm punchin the wall of writers block, loathing for recognition
Nowadays your not heard, unless your posing an image
With watered down lyrics that appeal to most who listen
Instead i'll water the roots so branches will replenish
Expanding elements that pioneers started building
Hiphop houses, so many free loading MC's
I feel theres only a few tenants who've been paying their fees
360 degrees what goes around comes back
I'm smoking mics as I inhale lies and exhale facts
Unfold the blueprints, the plans for improvement
Bridging gaps between the mind, ball point pen and the clueless
Innovation is useless once you forget the essence
So respect the architect. pick up your pens and start sketchin
Pick up your pens and start sketching..

[Chorus]
So MC's, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm
DJ's pay bills develop skills
And respect the architecht as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills
[scratch]
So respect the architect as we begin to build

As I open my slanty eyes to this place called earth
I contemplate how music has lost artistic worth
And I'm shrivled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing
With bags under my eyes on account of too much sleeping
Because of these lies in rap that I can't feel
Leaving me dazed with the phrase ""i keep it real""
How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears
I'd rather be fed in the mouth, to shit it out from the rear
Claiming their underground but underwater their wrinkling
And me like water buoys to that level I'm never sinking
Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lispin'
Then when finished biting them, find your front teeth missing
I see em sippin fine wines in spas, to match their image
Gimmicks.. I flap my jaws and their squads diminished
I don't mess with glocks but metaphorically in speech
I'd like to pump em' with more shots than diabetics receive
Then in a better place may they peacefully rest
In hopes that next time the blueprints they'll manifest
Check the blueprint...

A sad and lonely boy,
Did not know how to get better,

Sent me a super love,
And now I'm happy forever.

They say I'm just talking crazy,

I'll never let her go,
Forever I'm gonna hold on,

Don't wanna play no game,
Just wants our love to live on and on,

i always have fantastic plans no matter what to do
i hide my fears and leave you here
as rain falls down on you
do you believe and don't you know
the way it's always been
i realize that you don't care
about the hate i've ever seen

so hard to bear with you not there
but really no one seems to care

something inside is dying outside
flicker on a screen, unsure of what it means
something inside is dying outside
make it to the end and never try to befriend

i wake up in a desert land, i hold my head down deep
with all my inner sufferings i'll never fall asleep
this heart of mine, tortured in dreams,
too much to stay awake
the scars of fate, i lost my faith
its more than i can take

Before you go and walk out on me
Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.

I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-
And I was crying on the staircase-
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, Oh.

Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -
but you were everything to me-
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes-

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Oh, Oh.

I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say... yes.

Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.

Jazz,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Metal,"Well I know I could be just another stranger
But to you I guess I'm just another fool
And you swear you like to live your live in danger
Then you hide behind a wall of silly rules
Nobody thinks the way I do
I guess that nobody dares
Your head's so full of things
So set your mind free of them
I'm breaking the rules

Did you know that in the truth there's nothing stranger
I suppose you think I think I know it all

Nobody hears the things I say
I guess nobody cares
My head's so full of things
I'll set my mind free of them
I'm breaking the rules

Breaking all the rules
Can't you see they're nothing without you
Empty heads full of fool
Now you see I'm breakin' all the rules
Breakin' all the rules

Well I know that you would love to go to heaven
But you know that you're just too afraid to die
And I know that you would love to know the answers
But to you the truth is just another lie

Nobody hears the things I say
I guess nobody cares
My head's so full of things
I set my mind free of them
I'm breaking the rules

Breaking all the rules
Can't you see they're nothing without you
Empty heads full of fools
Now you see I'm breaking all the rules
Breaking all the rules

Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day
You'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold.
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taking you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it had everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin'
You're tryin' now
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're cryin'
You're cryin' now

Way down the street there's a lad in his place
He opens the door he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen
And you talk about anything

He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down there's a quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin

Country,"You know, I worked the Big Packet show in Fort Worth, Saturday night, 
We had all day Sunday to rest and relax, before I caught another flight. 
So I decided to walk down town an' get myself a little fresh air. 
Before long, I found myself in front of a big church on the corner of the square. 
Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound. 
So I just walked up the steps an' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down. 
But before I could, a young man walked over to me an said: ""Excuse me, Sir, 
""But I can't let you in with that big black hat, those jeans, that beard an' long hair. 

So I just left, went back outside, sat down on that kerbing, an I thought to myself: 
That's the house of the Lord. That guy's got the hell of a nerve. 
Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please. 
So right there, in front of that Church, I just knelt down on my knees. 

I said: ""Lord, I know I don't look like much, but I didn't think you'd mind. 
""I just wanted to be with your people, Lord: it's been a long time. 
""A while ago, a saw a wino over there in the alley, all bent over in tears, 
""An' I thought how one stained glass window, from this Church, would feed his family for years."" 

""Then there's those fine cars parked outside: too many for me to count. 
""Made me think how people walked for days to hear your sermon on the mount. 
""Then there's those fine ladies in the choir, Lord, singin' like they really love it. 
""Hell, last night, they were dancin' on the front row of my show: drinkin' beer, screamin: 'Sing Shove It.' 

""You know, even John the Baptist wouldn't be welcome in this place, 
""With his coat made of Camel hair an' sandals on his feet an' a long beard on his face. 
""You know, Lord, when you come back to get your children, an' take 'em beyond the clouds, 
""To live forever in Heaven with you: well, I'd sure hate to be in this crowd. 

""You know, Lord, I'm not perfect; some even call me no count. 
""But I'll tell you: I believe a man is judged by what's in his heart, not what's in his bank account. 
""So if this is what religion is: a big car, a suit an' a tie, 
""Then I might as well forget it Lord, 'cause I can't qualify. 

""Oh, by the way, Lord, right before they kicked me out, didn't I see a picture of you? 
""With sandals an' a beard. Believe you had long hair too."" 
""Well, this is Paycheck, signing off.

Country,"One dark and stormy night while riding down the line;
Railroad Bill, the engineer said, ""Boy, we'll have to fly!""
We've got to be on time, to meet old Number Four.
So sling the coal, we'll make it, boy, or never ride no more.
While in the rear boxcar, a lonely hobo lay,
Heading for his mother dear, who on her death-bed lay;
He raised a weary hand, to brush away a tear,
Not knowing his last drive was run, and Fate was drawing near.

When through the darkened night, a headlight bright did gleam,
O'er the roar of rolling wheels, a whistle load did scream;
As down around the curve, the mighty train did roar,
With black smoke rolling from the stack, came Flyer Number Four.

This ever changing world pushes me through another door

And my mind could not erase the beauty of you face
Just for awhile
Won't you let me shelter you

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
I wish that I could give you something more
That I could be yours

How do we explain something that took us by surprise
Promises in vain, love that is real but in disguise
What happens now
Do we break another rule
Let our lovers play the fool
I don't know how
To stop feeling this way

Repeat chorus

Well, I think that I've been true to everybody else but me
And the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be free

The reapers following.
A condemned club for both weak and poor.
I tear my new flesh. Ripping and wearing it out.
Trying to rise in a cast only I know exists.
Abstaining my yesterday. Welcome my tomorrow.
Let the present lead. Head my inner bleed.

My acts of foolishness. Victimize the perpetual soil.
I, I, I, I die alone.

Screaming, fighting and tearing my inside.
Screaming fight in me.

This is the first trace of a weak show.
I know that as I take my first step into this freak

Surrounded by my own stench. Panic rising,
Takes me further. This room has never looked this

Maybe you're the one who makes the winds blow

Maybe its not just down to you
oh god can we win back what we have lost
To who's the lost resort, Oh God

Tumbling towards unclear destinations
Do they wash away the flames the wind and the searing rains
As our powers interchange

Oh God can you tell us when its going to start
Maybe its not just down to you
Oh God can we win back what we have lost
To who's the lost resort, oh God

Oh God can you tell us when its going to stop

I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,

Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,

When my heart is still with you,

And ol' midnight knows it, too.

When a quarrel we had needs mending,

Does it mean that our love is ending.

Darlin' I need you, lately I find

You're out of my heart,

And I'm out of my mind.



Let our hearts take wings'

Let the angels sing,

for your returning.

Till our love is safe and sound.

And old midnight comes around.

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to work
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it -

- But I'm still here for y'all right now, man -
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
- This what I got to say right here, dawg, yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh -

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
- Y'know what I'm sayin'? When the doctor told me I had, um -
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
- That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said -
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
- ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"" -
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
- ""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""
You can't be serious, man -

Country,"(Feat. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson) 
I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",6.75,8.555555555555555

Rap,"""We'll have more news after this commercial word""
(As so it goes..)
""At least I think I was here asleep...
Is it possible, conceiveable that I sleepwalked out of my apartment
And went berzerk?""

[Aesop Rock]
In slipped rhythm
Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment
Parked in front the fan
And reminesce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand
'Tesants get the New York home game
With real life shoot-em-up action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art
Free game piece all included
I told this cat the earth was flat
He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
Brick-a-back novelty
Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed Tequilla worm future, be concerned
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the sand
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reaks of subway metal
Feather lecture journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with voices
Benefit to break room
Mummified manequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This a Malcom circus, got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you SUCKA!
I lay the Lord down upon its belly
With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk
Yelling 'Break yo'self!'
I'm the actualized data commission past penny tip jar donation
Been arranged, made by the farfetch from stability 
Took a heart pledge early on
Bled onto the drum doser
Plow in the metronome, home 
Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster
Sensation'll leave siesomgraph stabbin away on stone tablets
To sketch up out your future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
But have canceled developed, courtesy America
Land of the free base
Home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker
It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed
With dilapadated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece
A sweat a bit to make my Wookie ends meet
Pascifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate
Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit apparently
Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me'
Ok, time to buckle the fuck down 
Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You can catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process
Hence, your plight botches

""I don't know what got into me
I didn't even cause all that destruction
I'm sorry...so sorry""

We were captives on a casino ship.
Where the midwest lay out hours and burnt to crisp.
I spent a year as her hair lip,
but now I fall apart at night 
and dream about our trip.

But the first two weeks were great,
I felt content to watch the Entertainment Channel fornicate.

With flashes of you maturing into stage,
flawless masterpieces built of dreams I swore were memories.

And I dream, I dream, I dream..

I saw the ocean envelop the sky
Put out the sun on the day that we died,
The former, the latter, and all in between,
They were vanquished by looking a fiend.

Do you remember me, do you remember me?
The one that you loved when he set you free.
Do you remember me, do you remember me?
The one with who you fell beneath the sea.

Yeah, we killed, we killed it all night.
All night.
Yeah, we killed, we killed it all night.

down in Mexico
she had treinta margaritas
treinta years ago
her purse had just been stolen
she rad to make some cash
for fifty thousand pesos
the donkey fucked her ass

I'm so ashamed it makes me sick
my mothers box was his salt lick
human-donkey fornication
her taco is the destination

It soon became apparent
it wasn't for the dough
a genuine fiesta -
at the donkey show
the crowd would shout ""ole!""
as she nibbled on his sack
they never had a patron
demand their money back

A real freak show in the pit
the donkey's fucking my moms tits
acting like a true ranchero
dancing around a big sombrero

The donkey's name was Lucky
oh, boy, he loved to fuck
he'd get so damn excited
he'd kick and make you duck
if you want to be star
it's easy to be famous
just pull down your pants
let lucky fuck your anus

brings a blackened sky to fall

while you grow old

Gone whithout a trace (gone)

and left in tyranny

you're not alone
they've took your breath of life
and left your mind to unfold
lifeless and cold

Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back

Punk,"My mother fucked a donkey
down in Mexico
she had treinta margaritas
treinta years ago
her purse had just been stolen
she rad to make some cash
for fifty thousand pesos
the donkey fucked her ass

I'm so ashamed it makes me sick
my mothers box was his salt lick
human-donkey fornication
her taco is the destination

It soon became apparent
it wasn't for the dough
a genuine fiesta -
at the donkey show
the crowd would shout ""ole!""
as she nibbled on his sack
they never had a patron
demand their money back

A real freak show in the pit
the donkey's fucking my moms tits
acting like a true ranchero
dancing around a big sombrero

The donkey's name was Lucky
oh, boy, he loved to fuck
he'd get so damn excited
he'd kick and make you duck
if you want to be star
it's easy to be famous
just pull down your pants
let lucky fuck your anus

I'm so ashamed it makes me sick
my mothers box was his salt lick
acting like a true ranchero
dancing around a big sombrero

Lucky, the luckiest donkey

But I stand for what I care about

Rap,"Slowly and steadily MC's are fallin off like leprosy
Instead build immunity and spread insight through community
These fundamentals, form the krux of longevity
When melodies are looped and vocals harmonize in unity
Now its 99 and aint a damn thing changed
Some seek fame as wealth manipulates the brain
Let me, paint this picture, your minds the canvas
Many claim their real and later flake like dandruff
Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words
The other 9 stick to my nikes and get rubbed out on the curb
Lets be real, we're paper chasin' for financial backing
But theres a thin line defined by need and greed many are passing
Known as crossing over for exposure some embark
Or cars,jewels and shit that wont exist when we depart
Crews, don't snooze, or eyes become bruised

This goes out to those that slept knew the deal or were confused..
Check the blueprint..

[Chorus]
So MC's, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm
DJ's pay bills develop skills
And respect the architecht as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills..
[scratch]
So respect the architect as we begin to build

Clutchin my pen tight strugglin to portray the right depiction
I'm punchin the wall of writers block, loathing for recognition
Nowadays your not heard, unless your posing an image
With watered down lyrics that appeal to most who listen
Instead i'll water the roots so branches will replenish
Expanding elements that pioneers started building
Hiphop houses, so many free loading MC's
I feel theres only a few tenants who've been paying their fees
360 degrees what goes around comes back
I'm smoking mics as I inhale lies and exhale facts
Unfold the blueprints, the plans for improvement
Bridging gaps between the mind, ball point pen and the clueless
Innovation is useless once you forget the essence
So respect the architect. pick up your pens and start sketchin
Pick up your pens and start sketching..

[Chorus]
So MC's, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm
DJ's pay bills develop skills
And respect the architecht as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills
[scratch]
So respect the architect as we begin to build

As I open my slanty eyes to this place called earth
I contemplate how music has lost artistic worth
And I'm shrivled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing
With bags under my eyes on account of too much sleeping
Because of these lies in rap that I can't feel
Leaving me dazed with the phrase ""i keep it real""
How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears
I'd rather be fed in the mouth, to shit it out from the rear
Claiming their underground but underwater their wrinkling
And me like water buoys to that level I'm never sinking
Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lispin'
Then when finished biting them, find your front teeth missing
I see em sippin fine wines in spas, to match their image
Gimmicks.. I flap my jaws and their squads diminished
I don't mess with glocks but metaphorically in speech
I'd like to pump em' with more shots than diabetics receive
Then in a better place may they peacefully rest
In hopes that next time the blueprints they'll manifest
Check the blueprint...

Whipping me into a storm

Do not attempt to adjust your radio, there is nothing wrong.

Top of the Chocolate Milky Way, 500,000 kilowatts of P.Funk-power.

If you got faults, defects or shortcomings,
You know, like arthritis, rheumatism or migraines,
Whatever part of your body it is,
I want you to lay it on your radio, let the vibes flow through.
Funk not only moves, it can re-move, dig?
The desired effect is what you get
When you improve your Interplanetary Funksmanship.
Sir Lollipop Man! Chocolate coated, freaky and and habit forming.

Kind hearts don't grab any glory,

I'm sick reliving the past
My time it came and it passed
I'm holding on to the memories, making them last
So when you come around
You'll find me on the ground
Searching for a piece that I've never found

And I knew it was to be

because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run.
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.
If you had then where were you?
We've payed our dues without you.

Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?
Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through.
I am nothing like you!

Jazz,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

My senses disconnect
A virus attacks what I protect
No cure, my body's almost cold
Movie images I only hold

Following a one-way track
This moment oh so critical
God is not here to welcome me
Pain is just a memory

COME ON!!

Almost lifeless now it's fear
A light caresses me with heat
My body gets slowly destroyed
I am gonna be destroyed

All data taken by nothingness
My soulmate is gone like death
Light exits in the darkness
I'm almost dead, I am death

I feel the cold

Behind the light, I feel the cold
Behind the light, oblivion
Behind the light, I feel cold
Behind the light

UUURGHAA!!

A virus attacks what I protect
No cure my body's almost cold

[Exodus 31:34, Deuteronomy 5:7]
Bring us your trinkets, your baubles of gold
Join the debauchery, the young and the old
Let us bow down to his great golden calf
Darken our spirits, as we dance and we laugh

The golden calf takes shape - the idol of black hearts
The whole deed, from the sum of its parts
From the healer of sorrow came a great molten blast
With holy tongue of fire, the commandments were cast

Down from the mountain with two tablets of stone
In countenanc white, Moses walked down alone
Instructed by God to bring the people His word
Intoxicated by evil, their judgment obscured
Why should we listen to his set of his rules ?
Deeper in sin sinks the assembly of fools

Though shalt not make graven images
Visiting evil in the land of the dust
Though shalt not have other gods before Me
Then only then can you truly be free

Let us bow down to the King of kings
Melt down this idol and the evil it brings",4.4,8.181818181818182

""At least I think I was here asleep...
Is it possible, conceiveable that I sleepwalked out of my apartment
And went berzerk?""

[Aesop Rock]
In slipped rhythm
Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment
Parked in front the fan
And reminesce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand
'Tesants get the New York home game
With real life shoot-em-up action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art
Free game piece all included
I told this cat the earth was flat
He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
Brick-a-back novelty
Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed Tequilla worm future, be concerned
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the sand
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reaks of subway metal
Feather lecture journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with voices
Benefit to break room
Mummified manequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This a Malcom circus, got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you SUCKA!
I lay the Lord down upon its belly
With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk
Yelling 'Break yo'self!'
I'm the actualized data commission past penny tip jar donation
Been arranged, made by the farfetch from stability 
Took a heart pledge early on
Bled onto the drum doser
Plow in the metronome, home 
Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster
Sensation'll leave siesomgraph stabbin away on stone tablets
To sketch up out your future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
But have canceled developed, courtesy America
Land of the free base
Home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker
It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed
With dilapadated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece
A sweat a bit to make my Wookie ends meet
Pascifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate
Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit apparently
Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me'
Ok, time to buckle the fuck down 
Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You can catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process
Hence, your plight botches

I didn't even cause all that destruction
I'm sorry...so sorry""

We've shed our dream but we're
Time after time in a room full of strangers
Out of the blue, suddenly you were there

Glancing my way in the grey of the dawn

And always your smile holds that strange invitation

Then you are gone

Where oh where have you gone

Be where you are so near yet so far, apart

Rock,"How here's a little story - I've got to tell
About three bad brothers - you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock, M.C.A., and me - Mike D.
Been had a little horsy named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer
Riding across the land - kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse on my tail cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself - without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is gettin' hot - the beer is getting flat
Lookin' for a girl - I ran into a guy
His name is M.C.A., I said, ""Howdy"" - he said, ""Hi""

He told a little story - that sounded well rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand - and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry - he asked me for a sip
He said, ""Can I get some?""
I said, ""You can't get none!""
Had a chance to run
He pulled out his shotgun
He was quick on the draw - I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said,

""Now my name is M.C.A. - I've got a license to kill
I think you know what time it is - it's time to get ill
Now what do we have here - an outlaw and his beer
I run this land, you understand - I make myself clear.""
We stepped into the wind - he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over but it's ready to begin

""Now I got the gun - you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me"" I said, I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this - I did it like that
I did it with a whiffleball bat
So I'm on the run - the cop's got my gun
And right about now - it's time to have some fun
The King Adrock - that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.""
We rode for six hours the we hit the spot
The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
M.C.A. said, ""Yo, you know this kid?""
I said, ""I didn't."" - but I know he did
The kid said, ""Get ready cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money.""
Pulled out the jammy - aimed it at the sky
He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" - and let two fly
Hands went up and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
""I'm Mike D. and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect""
M.C.A. was with it and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face
The piano player's out - the music stopped
His boy had beef - and he got dropped
Mike D. grabbed the money - M.C.A. snatched the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold",15.25,9.819672131147541
Rock,"It was Cinco de Mayo
Pillow case on his head 
No more breathing time 
The ambulance sped
Sped 'round every corner 
Calling out his name

Shot a rabbit from the back seat window
Sat and watched the summer corn grow
Ate ice cream in a dessert dream
And got lost in father's singing
Too hot inside
Too hot outside
Lazy days when I said lets go for a ride
We'd sail on Spirit Lake
Me my pappy and his lemonade

Tim and Tina were my parents names
They got engaged
They were inflamed
Seduced by the luck of butterflies
How they glimmer how they shimmer
Those butterflies

We seven kids
We almost died
Nearly put to death
By lightening strikes
Instead there was hot pink
Flashes in the sky
We climbed the rocks in snow and rain
In search of magic powers
To heal our mother's pain

Shot a rabbit from the back seat window
Sat and watched the summer corn grow
Ate ice cream in a dessert dream
And got lost in father's singing
Too hot inside
Too hot outside
Lazy days when I said lets go for a ride
We'd sail on Spirit Lake
Me my pappy and his lemonade

Shot a rabbit from the back seat window
Sat and watched the summer corn grow
Ate ice cream in a dessert dream
And got lost in father's singing
Too hot inside
Too hot outside

Rap,"Slowly and steadily MC's are fallin off like leprosy
Instead build immunity and spread insight through community
These fundamentals, form the krux of longevity
When melodies are looped and vocals harmonize in unity
Now its 99 and aint a damn thing changed
Some seek fame as wealth manipulates the brain
Let me, paint this picture, your minds the canvas
Many claim their real and later flake like dandruff
Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words
The other 9 stick to my nikes and get rubbed out on the curb
Lets be real, we're paper chasin' for financial backing
But theres a thin line defined by need and greed many are passing
Known as crossing over for exposure some embark
Or cars,jewels and shit that wont exist when we depart
Crews, don't snooze, or eyes become bruised

This goes out to those that slept knew the deal or were confused..
Check the blueprint..

So MC's, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm

And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills..

So respect the architect as we begin to build

I'm punchin the wall of writers block, loathing for recognition

With watered down lyrics that appeal to most who listen
Instead i'll water the roots so branches will replenish
Expanding elements that pioneers started building
Hiphop houses, so many free loading MC's
I feel theres only a few tenants who've been paying their fees
360 degrees what goes around comes back
I'm smoking mics as I inhale lies and exhale facts
Unfold the blueprints, the plans for improvement
Bridging gaps between the mind, ball point pen and the clueless
Innovation is useless once you forget the essence
So respect the architect. pick up your pens and start sketchin
Pick up your pens and start sketching..

[Chorus]
So MC's, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm
DJ's pay bills develop skills
And respect the architecht as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills
[scratch]
So respect the architect as we begin to build

As I open my slanty eyes to this place called earth
I contemplate how music has lost artistic worth
And I'm shrivled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing
With bags under my eyes on account of too much sleeping
Because of these lies in rap that I can't feel
Leaving me dazed with the phrase ""i keep it real""
How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears
I'd rather be fed in the mouth, to shit it out from the rear
Claiming their underground but underwater their wrinkling
And me like water buoys to that level I'm never sinking
Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lispin'
Then when finished biting them, find your front teeth missing
I see em sippin fine wines in spas, to match their image
Gimmicks.. I flap my jaws and their squads diminished
I don't mess with glocks but metaphorically in speech
I'd like to pump em' with more shots than diabetics receive
Then in a better place may they peacefully rest
In hopes that next time the blueprints they'll manifest
Check the blueprint...

[chorus]
So MC's, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm
DJ's pay bills develop skills
And respect the architecht as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills

So respect the architect as we begin to build",11.571428571428571,8.493827160493828

My senses disconnect
A virus attacks what I protect
No cure, my body's almost cold
Movie images I only hold

Following a one-way track
This moment oh so critical
God is not here to welcome me
Pain is just a memory

COME ON!!

Almost lifeless now it's fear
A light caresses me with heat
My body gets slowly destroyed
I am gonna be destroyed

All data taken by nothingness
My soulmate is gone like death
Light exits in the darkness
I'm almost dead, I am death

I feel the cold

Behind the light, I feel the cold
Behind the light, oblivion
Behind the light, I feel cold

Railroad Bill, the engineer said, ""Boy, we'll have to fly!""
We've got to be on time, to meet old Number Four.
So sling the coal, we'll make it, boy, or never ride no more.
While in the rear boxcar, a lonely hobo lay,
Heading for his mother dear, who on her death-bed lay;
He raised a weary hand, to brush away a tear,
Not knowing his last drive was run, and Fate was drawing near.

When through the darkened night, a headlight bright did gleam,
O'er the roar of rolling wheels, a whistle load did scream;
As down around the curve, the mighty train did roar,
With black smoke rolling from the stack, came Flyer Number Four.

Then came an awful crash! Their last long drive was run,
On the track the hobo lay, his days of life were done;
And as the golden sun, sank slowly to the west,
His dear old mother gently smiled, and closed her eyes in death.",5.333333333333333,10.75

Where do we go from here
What do I do with these feelings
Longing to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

[Verse 1:]
Why must the bad things always feel so good
Why can't I just stay away
Thought our situation was understood, still does not mean it's okay

Where do we go from here
What do I do with these feelings
Longing to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

[Lalah:]
Why can't these memories just be erased
Why must I yearn for your kiss
The first moment we're not face to face
Reminds me how much your missed
Where do we go

Where do we go from here
What do I do with these feelings
Longing to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

[Eric & Lalah:]
When the morning comes
When it's time for us to go our separate ways
When this night is done, I be wanting to hold onto you
Ooooh the sun, I wish we could push it all away
Cause then we'll know that we can show what we have from the day

Where do we go from here (I need to know, I need to know)
What do I do with these feelings
Longinh to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

I need to know where do we gooooo oh
I know I should walk away something keeps telling me one mo day
Maybe if I'm patience then one day it would change yeaaaah

RnB,"Good evening.
Do not attempt to adjust your radio, there is nothing wrong.
We have taken control as to bring you this special show.
We will return it to you as soon as you are grooving.

Welcome to station WEFUNK, better known as We-Funk,
Or deeper still, the Mothership Connection.
Home of the extraterrestrial brothers,
Dealers of funky music.
P.Funk, uncut funk, The Bomb.

Coming to you directly from the Mothership
Top of the Chocolate Milky Way, 500,000 kilowatts of P.Funk-power.
So kick back, dig, while we do it to you in your eardrums.
And me? I'm known as Lollipop Man, alias the Long-Haired Sucker.
My motto is:

Make my funk the P.Funk
I want my funk uncut (make mine the P)
Make my funk the P.Funk
I wants to get funked up. (wants to get funked up)

Make my funk the P.Funk
I wants to get funked up.

WEFUNK, y'all.
Now this is what I want you all to do:
If you got faults, defects or shortcomings,
You know, like arthritis, rheumatism or migraines,
Whatever part of your body it is,
I want you to lay it on your radio, let the vibes flow through.
Funk not only moves, it can re-move, dig?
The desired effect is what you get
When you improve your Interplanetary Funksmanship.
Sir Lollipop Man! Chocolate coated, freaky and and habit forming.
Doin' it to you in 3-D,
So groovy that I dig me.

I want the P.Funk

That's the law around here, you got to wear your sunglasses.
So you can feel cool.
Gangster lean.
Y'all should dig my sun-rooftop.
Well, allright. Hey I was diggin' on y'alls funk for awhile.
Sounds like it got a three on it though, to me.
Then I was down south and I heard some funk with some main ingredients
Like Doobie Brothers, Blue Magic, David Bowie.
It was cool,
But can you imagine Doobiein' your funk? Ho!

Could give me a look, sweet on the vine

Ryzarector, Madman, uh, uhh, yo, uhh
I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I lived, a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, C-cypher power stalk plus the fiend talk
Three G's accost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisonin the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blastin
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened, shhhh
Trapped in deep-water gaspin
I Clash With the Titans from my half on the action

[Verse Two: RZA]
I stop producers careers, the weak spot was their ears
Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still peeled it still they're living built tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body has a tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches
Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable
Interchangable, caution flameable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable, angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retrieve through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

[Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef]
(Assassination day)
First of all, before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon
Don, spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurgin, mergin in the suburbs, using this just like an adverb
Action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aimin like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pah
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Hold on like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high
Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shootin it like they blew top snow
You won't play me like your lady
Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby
Final destination Haiti

[Verse Four: Masta Killa]
War is extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in 
Murdereous rhymin, constantly in climbin
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback...

Electronic,"Looking out a dirty old window,
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by,
I see it here alone and I wonder why,
Friday night and everyone's moving.
I can feel the heat but its soothing heading down,
I search for the beat in this dirty town,

Downtown the young ones are going,
Downtown the young ones are growing,

[Chorus:]
We're the kids in America,
We're the kids in America,
Everybody live for the music around,

Bright Lights,
The music gets faster,
Look boy don't check on your watch, Not another glance,
I'm not leaving now honey not a chance,
Hot shot give me no problems,
Much later baby you'll be, saying ""nevermind,""
You know life is cruel,
Life is never kind,

Kind hearts don't make a new story,
Kind hearts don't grab any glory,

[Chorus:]
We're the kids in America,
We're the kids in America,
Everybody live for the music around,

Come closer honey thats better,
Gotta get a brand new experience feeling right,
Oh, don't try to stop baby hold me tight,
Outside a new day is dawning,
Outside suburbia calling, everywhere,
I don't want to go baby,
New York to East California,
There's a new way come in on ya,

We're the kids in America,

Pop,"What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?
I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping

Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion

Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
but darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
and I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need...

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Everytime I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming
Begging, pleading
No more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, Oh

I'm about to break
And I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, Oh

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this moment
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I say...
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

Only thing I need to do is walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from ya

Recounting past events has helped reveal that you don't give a damn

Not the person who you were; I hate the person you've become.
You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.

because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run.
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.
If you had then where were you?
We've payed our dues without you.

Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?
Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through.
I am nothing like you!

Big city life would bring it death
A close personal friend of mine
My lovely little Frankenstein
It listens as I quietly talk
While hand in hand on our nightly walk
I get lost in it's eyes as it stares into mine

Somehow I knew you could never.. never stay

I can tell you how I feel
In my dreams I can hold you

Why can't we live the way we want
I want the world to know
I just gotta let it show
What do we stand to lose

Is what we choose

About us

Country,"See the ruin on the hill, where the smoke is hanging still,
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.",5.2,10.038461538461538

Glancing my way in the grey of the dawn

to see if it's all true. Confide in me.

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Seems she ran aground on manoeuvres
One of our submarines
A hungry heart
To regulate their breathing
One more night
The Winter Boys are freezing in their spam time
The Baltic moon
Along the northern seaboard
And down below
The Winter Boys are waiting for the storm

Bye-bye empire, empire bye-bye
Shallow water - channel and tide

And I can trace my history
Down one generation to my home
In one of our submarines
One of our submarines

The red lights flicker, sonar weak
Air valves hissing open
Half her pressure blown away
Flounder in the ocean
See the Winter Boys
Drinking heavy water from a stone

Bye-bye empire, empire bye-bye

Rap,"I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's
Cause they don't make no songs like these

Stop me and steal my breath
Emeralds from mountains thrust towards the sky
Never revealing their depth

Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

And I'll be your crying shoulder
I'll be love suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

As we lie awake in my bed

That love is alive and not dead

So tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated
I'll hang from your lipsInstead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

And I'll be your crying shoulder
I'll be love suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

And I dropped out, I burned up
I fought my way back from the dead
And I tuned in, I turned on
Remembered the things that you said

And I'll be your crying shoulder
I'll be love suicide
And I'll be better when I'm older

Country,"There's some left over wine in the cupboard
About a half a glass left for the road
Here's a toast to the time we were lovers---then I'll go
Should I laugh, or should I cry
Love you, hate you, live or die
Is my heart half full or half empty
Is our love like the wine in this glass
You drink like there's no tomorrow
So sure, it will always last
Will the memories tase sweet as they linger
Or the bitterness stay on my tongue
Is my heart half full of the love you gave me
Or my heart half empty cuz your love is gone

Your bags are all packed in the hallway
The boxes are stacked on the lawn
You kiss me goodbye just like always
And you're gone
Trembling hands or nerves of steel
Someone tell me what to feel

Is my heart half full or half empty
Is our love like the wine in this glass
You drink like there's no tomorrow
So sure, it will always last
Will the memories tase sweet as they linger
Or the bitterness stay on my tongue
Is my heart half full of the love you gave me
Or my heart half empty (half empty) cuz your love is gone

Should I laugh or should I cry
Love you, hate you, live or die

Is my heart half full or half empty
Is our love like the wine in this glass
You drink like there's no tomorrow
And we were so sure (so sure) it will always last
Will the memories tase sweet as they linger
Or the bitterness stay on my tongue
Is my heart half full of the love you gave me

Is my heart half empty (half empty)

Rap,"Message Post: 6/10/90-never Subject: Louis Logic. You said it folks, this guy is clever
He got extra dope rhymes and punchlines forever. His stuff would catch in no time if his production guy was better
And there's nothing I like better than new battle lyrics. My favorite jam's Secret Agent, man. You have to hear it!
I heard it got a fat review in a mag or two, and now the majors want him. It would suck if that was true
It ain't a cat half as fat as Lou that's as true to stayin' indie, or dudes with punchlines on major labels sayin' any
He even answers all his e-mails if he's got a chance at all, and told me Ikon's real name was Vinnie

Maybe when he's gettin' chased by a bunch of sweaty faced, record snakes with chainsaws and machete blades

In pursuit like Leatherface and Jason, He'll be the first kid who don't forget his place and sustains the basement

Slow motion daylight
A lone pair of watchful eyes
Oversee the living
Feel the presence all around
A tortured soul
A wound unhealing
No regrets or promises
The past is gone
But you can still be free
If time will set you free
Time now to spread your wings
To take to flight
The life endeavour
Aim for the burning sun
You're trapped inside
But you can still be free
If time will set you free
But it's a long long way to go

Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free
If time will set you free

Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight
And you can still be free
If time will set you free
And going higher than the mountain tops
And go high like the wind don't stop
And go high
Free to fly tonight

Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir

It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock

When I'm racing in carpool lane
to sell shit to an art school lame

But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail

When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows

Cuz I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars

Country,"You know, I worked the Big Packet show in Fort Worth, Saturday night, 
We had all day Sunday to rest and relax, before I caught another flight. 
So I decided to walk down town an' get myself a little fresh air. 
Before long, I found myself in front of a big church on the corner of the square. 
Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound. 
So I just walked up the steps an' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down. 
But before I could, a young man walked over to me an said: ""Excuse me, Sir, 
""But I can't let you in with that big black hat, those jeans, that beard an' long hair. 

So I just left, went back outside, sat down on that kerbing, an I thought to myself: 
That's the house of the Lord. That guy's got the hell of a nerve. 
Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please. 
So right there, in front of that Church, I just knelt down on my knees. 

I said: ""Lord, I know I don't look like much, but I didn't think you'd mind. 
""I just wanted to be with your people, Lord: it's been a long time. 
""A while ago, a saw a wino over there in the alley, all bent over in tears, 
""An' I thought how one stained glass window, from this Church, would feed his family for years."" 

""Then there's those fine cars parked outside: too many for me to count. 
""Made me think how people walked for days to hear your sermon on the mount. 
""Then there's those fine ladies in the choir, Lord, singin' like they really love it. 
""Hell, last night, they were dancin' on the front row of my show: drinkin' beer, screamin: 'Sing Shove It.' 

""You know, even John the Baptist wouldn't be welcome in this place, 
""With his coat made of Camel hair an' sandals on his feet an' a long beard on his face. 
""You know, Lord, when you come back to get your children, an' take 'em beyond the clouds, 
""To live forever in Heaven with you: well, I'd sure hate to be in this crowd. 

""You know, Lord, I'm not perfect; some even call me no count. 
""But I'll tell you: I believe a man is judged by what's in his heart, not what's in his bank account. 
""So if this is what religion is: a big car, a suit an' a tie, 
""Then I might as well forget it Lord, 'cause I can't qualify. 

""Oh, by the way, Lord, right before they kicked me out, didn't I see a picture of you? 
""With sandals an' a beard. Believe you had long hair too.""

I would have loved you like no other babe
But a poet needs his pain
And sometimes life can be so cruel
It will pick you up and drop you down again
So if you try to love me darling please refrain
I'm still searching for the pieces
Someone else once took away
You know I used to love with all my heart
But how the times they can change.

Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart.

I've seen a lot of heartache and I've walked a lonely road
They say the darkest times before the dawn
But the rooster hasn't crowed
And when you wake up in the morning
Oh my darling I'll be gone

Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart

No I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart.

And it's a crying game
It's a crying shame

Country,"See the ruin on the hill, where the smoke is hanging still,
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

demand their money back

Crazy wavelengths leave you helpless

Watching them flying in formation
Thinking how I could be so immune

Country,"See the ruin on the hill, where the smoke is hanging still,
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.",5.2,10.038461538461538

And went berzerk?""

Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment
Parked in front the fan
And reminesce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand

With real life shoot-em-up action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art
Free game piece all included

He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
Brick-a-back novelty
Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed Tequilla worm future, be concerned
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the sand
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reaks of subway metal
Feather lecture journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with voices
Benefit to break room
Mummified manequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This a Malcom circus, got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you SUCKA!
I lay the Lord down upon its belly
With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk
Yelling 'Break yo'self!'
I'm the actualized data commission past penny tip jar donation
Been arranged, made by the farfetch from stability 
Took a heart pledge early on
Bled onto the drum doser
Plow in the metronome, home 
Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster
Sensation'll leave siesomgraph stabbin away on stone tablets
To sketch up out your future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
But have canceled developed, courtesy America
Land of the free base
Home of the triplicate grill character

It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed
With dilapadated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece
A sweat a bit to make my Wookie ends meet
Pascifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate
Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit apparently
Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me'
Ok, time to buckle the fuck down 
Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You can catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process
Hence, your plight botches

I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-
And I was crying on the staircase-
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, Oh.

Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -
but you were everything to me-
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.

of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 
in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..

As I, turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat 
This wind is blowin' my mind 
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat 
Who am I, to be blind? 
Pretending not to see their needs 
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top 
And a one man's soul 
They follow each other on the wind ya' know 
'Cause they got no where to go 
That's why I want you to know 

I'm starting with the man in the mirror 
I'm asking him to change his ways 
And no message could have been any clearer 
If you wanna make the world a better place 
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change 

(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah) 

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love 
It's time that I realize 
That there are some with no home, not a nickle to loan 
Could it really be me, pretending that they're not alone? 

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart 
And a washed-out dream 
(Washed out dream) 
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya' see 
'Cause they got no place to be 
That's why I'm starting with me 

I'm starting with the man in the mirror 
I'm asking him to change his ways 
And no message could have been any clearer 
If you wanna make the world a better place 
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da
Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta
Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water
Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand
Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that
What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

""Sei sulla buona strada"", mi dico pensando a te
la nebbia si dirada e tutto è più chiaro in me;
sì, sulla buona strada non voglio più guerra io
né prendere per terra i pezzi di un altro addio.
Non finirà, non finirà, come una scena crollata a metà.

Io, caduto sopra il mondo
a rincorrere il grande momento;
io, a credere che il tempo
ormai non mi spezzerà mai più.

Sei sulla buona strada, due ali nei passi miei
è tempo di rialzarsi, c'è tanta fiducia ormai;
Sì, sulla buona strada, che grande occasione c'è,
la giusta direzione si traccia davanti a me.
Non finirà, non finirà come un discorso lasciato a metà.

Io, caduto sopra il mondo
a difendere il mio grande sogno;
io, a credere ogni giorno:
qualcosa succederà per noi.

Silenzi disperati, (cercando tenere parole)
noi, pensieri spaventati, (innamorati di questa vita)
noi, sorrisi appena nati che non si fermano più, mai più.

When my heart is still with you,

And ol' midnight knows it, too.

You're out of my heart,

Rap,"I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back

Claim ta, unrolled myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap

Streets deceiving
Can't believe my achievements

Because I don't need nada except for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
To my g's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix
Caked up, tryna take what I'm eating
Came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this

Said I was a thug with a notty head

Black cop cop a plea

And the whole race dichotomy

Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us

Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love

I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love

Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair

But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love",8.75,5.285714285714286

Yo... it's like waking up from a bad dream
Just to figure out you weren't dreaming in the first place

If all I saw was gangsters
Coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung ta
Claim ta, unrolled myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap
I'm amongst tha
Streets deceiving
Can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata
Persona's that of a non-needer
Because I don't need nada except for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
To my g's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix
Caked up, tryna take what I'm eating
Came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy mouth
Wild, hardly
A man's man
Who woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebel's and Stella McCartney's
For years, all that
How could I not be dead
This old German
Said I was a thug with a notty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see
From my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme
My stories is I'm from the home of the thieves

[Verse 2:]
Blessed
The lord is a g, he gotta be
Who's the God of suckers and snitches
The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe
Blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive
Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder
Black cop cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers, athletes, and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances, trends, and fashion
But when it comes to residuals, they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tee's, blue jeans, and red bandanas

Rap,"Momma never said it would be like this
I never knew such bliss existed
Or maybe it's just so indescribable
Love was liable to get her twisted
She never told me but if she tried I was a little too young it floated right by me
I never dreamed love so fulfilling it's simply killing and over spilling on me
It goes on and on ... 

This ain't no ordinary love
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun

I refuse to believe we're a dying breed
Children of peace hope and harmony
Ordinary folks extraordinary love
Something from above
Something we fall short of
You can't see with an untrained eye 
But if you take a little time you are sure to find it
We complicate something so basic 
But once you taste it you gonna chase it like me
It goes on and on ...

A - yo here we go, open up the gates and let it flow ... 
Love's gonna take us higher

This ain't no ordinary love
It's extraordinary love",4.6,7.565217391304348

Down below the cars in the city go rushing by,
I see it here alone and I wonder why,
Friday night and everyone's moving.
I can feel the heat but its soothing heading down,
I search for the beat in this dirty town,

Downtown the young ones are going,
Downtown the young ones are growing,

We're the kids in America,
We're the kids in America,
Everybody live for the music around,

Bright Lights,
The music gets faster,
Look boy don't check on your watch, Not another glance,
I'm not leaving now honey not a chance,
Hot shot give me no problems,
Much later baby you'll be, saying ""nevermind,""
You know life is cruel,
Life is never kind,

Kind hearts don't make a new story,
Kind hearts don't grab any glory,

We're the kids in America,
We're the kids in America,
Everybody live for the music around,

Come closer honey thats better,
Gotta get a brand new experience feeling right,
Oh, don't try to stop baby hold me tight,
Outside a new day is dawning,
Outside suburbia calling, everywhere,
I don't want to go baby,
New York to East California,
There's a new way come in on ya,

down in Mexico
she had treinta margaritas
treinta years ago
her purse had just been stolen
she rad to make some cash
for fifty thousand pesos
the donkey fucked her ass

I'm so ashamed it makes me sick
my mothers box was his salt lick
human-donkey fornication
her taco is the destination

It soon became apparent
it wasn't for the dough
a genuine fiesta -
at the donkey show
the crowd would shout ""ole!""
as she nibbled on his sack
they never had a patron
demand their money back

A real freak show in the pit
the donkey's fucking my moms tits
acting like a true ranchero
dancing around a big sombrero

The donkey's name was Lucky
oh, boy, he loved to fuck
he'd get so damn excited
he'd kick and make you duck
if you want to be star
it's easy to be famous
just pull down your pants
let lucky fuck your anus

In slipped rhythm
Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment
Parked in front the fan
And reminesce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand
'Tesants get the New York home game
With real life shoot-em-up action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art
Free game piece all included
I told this cat the earth was flat
He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
Brick-a-back novelty
Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed Tequilla worm future, be concerned
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the sand
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reaks of subway metal
Feather lecture journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with voices
Benefit to break room
Mummified manequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This a Malcom circus, got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you SUCKA!
I lay the Lord down upon its belly
With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk
Yelling 'Break yo'self!'
I'm the actualized data commission past penny tip jar donation
Been arranged, made by the farfetch from stability 
Took a heart pledge early on
Bled onto the drum doser
Plow in the metronome, home 
Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster
Sensation'll leave siesomgraph stabbin away on stone tablets
To sketch up out your future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
But have canceled developed, courtesy America
Land of the free base
Home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker
It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed
With dilapadated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece
A sweat a bit to make my Wookie ends meet
Pascifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate
Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit apparently
Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me'
Ok, time to buckle the fuck down 
Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You can catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process
Hence, your plight botches

Be happy while you may

There's always one, beneath the sun

Who's bound to make you feel that way

The moon is shining, and that's a good sign

Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine

Remember, darling, we won't see it shine

A hundred years from today

A hundred years from today



Don't save your kisses, just pass them around

You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound

Who's going to know that you passed them around

A hundred years from today!

Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen

You're nearer heaven on Mother Earth's green

If you had millions what would they all mean

A hundred years from today

So laugh and sing, make love the thing

Be happy while you may

There's always one, beneath the sun

Who's bound to make you feel that way

The moon is shining, and that's a good sign

Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine

The scent of flowers in the air
Your perfume is subtle and everywhere
Breath so sweet and warm against my skin
I breathe in deep and take you in...

Your beauty takes my breath away
And in your embrace is where I want to stay
I've got to do all that I can to get close to you
Whoa...yeah

Chorus

Gaia...I adore you
Gaia... I implore you
Give us one more chance...

Verse 2

In you I move, in you I live
Like a baby in a mother's womb
The gift of life is what you give 
I'm so deeply filled with gratitude
My faith in life has been renewed

Your beauty takes my breath away
And in your embrace is where I want to stay 
I've got to do all that I can to get close to you

Love me love me

leave me leave me

Love me love me
say that you love me
leave me leave me
just say that you need me

spent my nights awake and I wonder
what I could have done in another way
to make you stay
Reason will not pledge a solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
as long as you don't go

And when they play The Wedding Samba

She'll say ""I do"" and seal it with a samba beat

Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be?

Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone

It seems like eternity

Country,"We were both young, when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-
And I was crying on the staircase-
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, Oh.

Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -
but you were everything to me-
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes-

This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Oh, Oh.

I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say... yes.

You said you started up this home 
because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run.
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.
If you had then where were you?
We've payed our dues without you.

Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?
Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through.
I am nothing like you!

This is the last time you will have us.
You're lawless and purely dishonest.

Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back

Trying to hide your face on my shoulder
Cannot change the way you feel for me
Don't want to see you cry
When you think of me

I know it's hurting you seeing me like this
You will remember this for the longest time

Don't let these images become a curse

Illusions in words confusing me
Your voice sounds so unreal

Don't tell me you cannot forget
I see future black

Just waiting for my day to come
To be released from agony

What's the use of holding on,
the few more times I'll see the sun",2.4285714285714284,6.352941176470588

A tearless stare
encased by fear
like a thread my heart is torn
and ripped right from my soul
with no control

Suits in disguise then fades to red
brings a blackened sky to fall
and make you very cold
while you grow old

Gone whithout a trace (gone)
it's left me chained and bound
my heart you thrust a dagger
my life and dreams are shattered
and left in tyranny

Rapture or pain
you spill my blood and take my life away
rapture or pain
all adversions still remain

You've realized
you're not alone
they've took your breath of life
and left your mind to unfold
lifeless and cold

Your thoughts erased
it's death you taste
your searing face
it hides the scars of love

Gone whithout a trace (gone)
it's left me chained and bound
my heart you thrust a dagger
my life and dreams are shattered
and left in tyranny

Rapture or pain
you spill my blood and take my life away
rapture or pain
all adversions still remain

Rapture or pain
you spill my blood and take my life away
rapture or pain
all adversions still remain",4.555555555555555,4.951219512195122

With real life shoot-em-up action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art

Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed Tequilla worm future, be concerned
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the sand
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reaks of subway metal
Feather lecture journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with voices
Benefit to break room
Mummified manequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet

Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate
Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit apparently
Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me'

The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process
Hence, your plight botches

I'm sorry...so sorry""

Rows of cotton 'bout knee high
Mrs. Baker down the dirt road
Still got clothes out on the line
Erwin Nichols there with Judge Lee
Playin checkers at the gin
When I dream about the southland,
This is where it all begins

From Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama

Muddy water, Misssissippi,
Blessed Graceland whispers to me,
Carry on, carry on,

Chasin fireflies by the creek
Kissin Gary William's sister,
On the porch Homecomin' week,
With rusty cars and weeping willows,
Keepin' watch out in the yard
Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie

In Carolina or in Georgia
Open arms are waitin for ya,

Old man river whispers to me,
Carry on, carry on,

By these priceless memories
I don't have to think about it
There's no place I'd rather be

Country,"An old man was sitting at his table one day
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I coming to see her real soon I hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last

The postman was passing and picked up the note
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke
Straight up into heaven this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know",5.0,9.2

When melodies are looped and vocals harmonize in unity

Let me, paint this picture, your minds the canvas
Many claim their real and later flake like dandruff
Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words
The other 9 stick to my nikes and get rubbed out on the curb
Lets be real, we're paper chasin' for financial backing

Bridging gaps between the mind, ball point pen and the clueless

And I'm shrivled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing

Because of these lies in rap that I can't feel
Leaving me dazed with the phrase ""i keep it real""
How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears
I'd rather be fed in the mouth, to shit it out from the rear

And me like water buoys to that level I'm never sinking
Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lispin'
Then when finished biting them, find your front teeth missing
I see em sippin fine wines in spas, to match their image
Gimmicks.. I flap my jaws and their squads diminished
I don't mess with glocks but metaphorically in speech
I'd like to pump em' with more shots than diabetics receive
Then in a better place may they peacefully rest
In hopes that next time the blueprints they'll manifest
Check the blueprint...

And respect the architecht as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills

Railroad Bill, the engineer said, ""Boy, we'll have to fly!""
We've got to be on time, to meet old Number Four.
So sling the coal, we'll make it, boy, or never ride no more.
While in the rear boxcar, a lonely hobo lay,
Heading for his mother dear, who on her death-bed lay;
He raised a weary hand, to brush away a tear,
Not knowing his last drive was run, and Fate was drawing near.

When through the darkened night, a headlight bright did gleam,
O'er the roar of rolling wheels, a whistle load did scream;
As down around the curve, the mighty train did roar,
With black smoke rolling from the stack, came Flyer Number Four.

Then came an awful crash! Their last long drive was run,
On the track the hobo lay, his days of life were done;
And as the golden sun, sank slowly to the west,
His dear old mother gently smiled, and closed her eyes in death.",5.333333333333333,10.75

Rap,"[Talking: Nas]
Yo... it's like waking up from a bad dream
Just to figure out you weren't dreaming in the first place
[Verse 1:]
If all I saw was gangsters
Coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung ta
Claim ta, unrolled myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap
I'm amongst tha
Streets deceiving
Can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata
Persona's that of a non-needer
Because I don't need nada except for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
To my g's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix
Caked up, tryna take what I'm eating
Came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy mouth
Wild, hardly
A man's man
Who woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebel's and Stella McCartney's
For years, all that
How could I not be dead
This old German
Said I was a thug with a notty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see
From my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme
My stories is I'm from the home of the thieves

[Verse 2:]
Blessed
The lord is a g, he gotta be
Who's the God of suckers and snitches
The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe
Blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive
Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder
Black cop cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers, athletes, and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances, trends, and fashion
But when it comes to residuals, they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tee's, blue jeans, and red bandanas

[Verse 3:]
Assassinations
Diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people
Built a new nation
Involuntary labor
Took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby
Let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700's
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite
Through your covenant
Love to sit in on the Senate
And tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair
She read about herself in the bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron
Like bring me my dinner, dear
She the nigger here
Ain't we in the free world
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls
Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casually
Bugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me
How far we really from third world savagery
When the empire fall, imagine how crazy that'll be",28.333333333333332,5.894117647058824

Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 
in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..
I don't know you and no, 
I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
No patience is in me and if you offend me 
I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air

I understand you gotta rest yours true, nigga my people's dead

Mr. Bush sit down, I'm in charge of the war!

Yes yes y'all, the I-N-S bless y'all
Stop hearts like cholesterol, let's brawl
Never fall, tear it down like a wreckin ball

And all for one, we draw the guns on impulse
Cash in the envelope, spend it on kinfolk
Then smoke a ounce as we count mills
Providin you pure ecstasy without pills

How the fuck did we get so cool man?

Brothers that'll kill for the will of the righteous
Twenty-five to lifers, true and livin snipers
You wait like ""Sixth Sense"" 'til hard to kill

Serial killers tote guns without the serial
High-tech, street intellect, all digital

Took a year hiatus, now you wanna hate us
Thanks to all you haters for all the cream you made us

You know I used to love with all my heart
But how the times they can change.

I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart

Country,"(Feat. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson) 
I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",6.75,8.555555555555555

I never knew such bliss existed
Or maybe it's just so indescribable
Love was liable to get her twisted
She never told me but if she tried I was a little too young it floated right by me
I never dreamed love so fulfilling it's simply killing and over spilling on me
It goes on and on ... 

This ain't no ordinary love
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun

I refuse to believe we're a dying breed
Children of peace hope and harmony
Ordinary folks extraordinary love
Something from above
Something we fall short of
You can't see with an untrained eye 
But if you take a little time you are sure to find it
We complicate something so basic 
But once you taste it you gonna chase it like me
It goes on and on ...

A - yo here we go, open up the gates and let it flow ...

I would have loved you like no other babe
But a poet needs his pain
And sometimes life can be so cruel
It will pick you up and drop you down again
So if you try to love me darling please refrain
I'm still searching for the pieces
Someone else once took away
You know I used to love with all my heart
But how the times they can change.

Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart.

I've seen a lot of heartache and I've walked a lonely road
They say the darkest times before the dawn
But the rooster hasn't crowed
And when you wake up in the morning
Oh my darling I'll be gone

Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart
No I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart.

So many fools fall in love
And it's a crying game
It's a crying shame
That I'm not a fool in love
But I know what I'm feeling 
And my heart is still healing

Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart

Sitting beside me was a man with no hair
From the look on his face and the size of his toes
He comes from a place that nobody knows
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee
He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie
He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky
He says they'll come get him, come get him some day

He says where he's from is called Albertane
There they use more than 10% of the brain
But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave
They run around in underwear and they never shave

Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane
And left me at the bus stop just barely sane

for fifty thousand pesos

it wasn't for the dough
a genuine fiesta -

as she nibbled on his sack

demand their money back

And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend

There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC

Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot

Let the angels sing,

Till our love is safe and sound.

Rap,"[Intro - Ja Rule - talking]
Yeah ... ha, uh huh
You know how we do (we're gonna do how we do)
Uh, uh, yo my nigga Cad what's hangin nigga (gangsta shit)
Nigga Terry what's goin on nigga
Let me talk to 'em for a minute (Murder Inc. bosses in the building)
Yeah, haha

[Chorus]
Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about the benjamins and nobody ain't doin it like us
C'mon what y'all want?

Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about sex, money, and murder
Bitches that burn ya, niggas with burners
Cocked and let go!

[Verse 1]
Fuck all y'all motherfuckin bitch ass niggas
I'm talkin to whoever wanna be ridin my dick
And you know your gon' get it as hot as I spit it
It's the Rule and nobody wanna be bothered with
If I hit 'em in every direction with four fifths
Will expend like 45's with compact discs (c'mon)
It's a disappointment to see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed
When I'm one of rap's anointed
Who else used to order it all on the dick
Like when I come through with spinners on the six
And got bitches bouncin like Ronnie in Tricks
But some whores in this game really don't make sense
Bomb roof and via Cal's and clonin Ems
But when bullets go through your film, we break your limbs
A horror show, yeah picture this
Cause I guess you can't see it, it's Murder again

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Rule I fuck with bitches in Manolos and thick Louie Vuitton logos
Cause I don't love these hoes
I'm above and beyond everything that your seein
And I'm the only real nigga left rappin this freakin
If I could be one of the seasons, you'd call me summer
The way I bang the heater out the back of the Hummer
The bull just move like runners from city block to city block
Layin down the foundation for what's really hot
Y'all niggas really not on my level (c'mon)
I'm like slugs when they pierce the metal, you see sparks (what)
My voice is a brush, they hear it it's like art
And nobody can really tell the twins apart
I call one Nina, other one Santa Maria
I might roll up on your set, dump and lean ya
My bitch is cocked to bang men in Virginia
Don't make me run up on ya, put a few in ya

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yo, Murder's outlaw, that guess I get a city's a broads
So I push the Porsche high and truck to court
Holla at the judge if the judge made a bad decision
I feel like the nigga that triggerin guns with mittens
It's hard to get done, I'm hearin that security runs
around 30K, if they don't get hit with an AK
And found out that the security's runnin another way
Like with me, it's Murder, probably
If I could drop in to manslaughter get a bail and flee
Cause my downess says bitch up, let her handle the pick up
Snow cone the country leave no market untouched
Call me drugs if this is how they pushin us rafters
But I don't do it cause I need it, I do it cause I want more
Definition is greed, I do it cause I want yours
And y'all niggas is teasin, y'all don't really want war
But if you really do, your gonna need a lot more

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro - Ja Rule - talking]
Faggots, haha (Panna Banana what up)
Yeah, shout out to my nigga 01 (my nigga Holla, I see you baby)
Baby, you know what I mean? My nigga Black Child (Joe, what up nigga)
Big Caddillac, my motherfuckin partner my brother
What up Gotti, you know how we gonna do these niggas
You ain't got to pick up no mic either my nigga

He got extra dope rhymes and punchlines forever. His stuff would catch in no time if his production guy was better
And there's nothing I like better than new battle lyrics. My favorite jam's Secret Agent, man. You have to hear it!
I heard it got a fat review in a mag or two, and now the majors want him. It would suck if that was true
It ain't a cat half as fat as Lou that's as true to stayin' indie, or dudes with punchlines on major labels sayin' any
He even answers all his e-mails if he's got a chance at all, and told me Ikon's real name was Vinnie

Maybe when he's gettin' chased by a bunch of sweaty faced, record snakes with chainsaws and machete blades

We've got to be on time, to meet old Number Four.
So sling the coal, we'll make it, boy, or never ride no more.
While in the rear boxcar, a lonely hobo lay,
Heading for his mother dear, who on her death-bed lay;
He raised a weary hand, to brush away a tear,
Not knowing his last drive was run, and Fate was drawing near.

When through the darkened night, a headlight bright did gleam,
O'er the roar of rolling wheels, a whistle load did scream;
As down around the curve, the mighty train did roar,
With black smoke rolling from the stack, came Flyer Number Four.

Then came an awful crash! Their last long drive was run,
On the track the hobo lay, his days of life were done;
And as the golden sun, sank slowly to the west,
His dear old mother gently smiled, and closed her eyes in death.",5.333333333333333,10.75

Sigue a su misión, con discreción
Roba todo lo que llama la atención
Busca a su chica, pura emoción
A los consortes del bando
Pues Pepe ya salió del fango

Aunque tenga que decírtelo a la cara
No me voy a limitar
Te creíste que eras vivo,
Que mi chica te ganabas
Ahora ves, te deje sin nada
Sin chica para bailar
Ni lujo pa' impresionar
Te pasó, por no pensar
Que los demás también ganan
Y por gracias al señor

Bright lights,
TV screen.
Feels like looking at a magazine.
You learn,
on the floor.
Feels like dancing is the way to go.

But if you let her see that fancy footwork,
show her that you're not that shy.
Let her see that fancy footwork,
show her you're that type of guy.

Young boy,
won't be late.
This girl ain't really got time to wait.

You think,
it's all for show,
but this is just the only way I know.

show her that you're not that shy.
Let her see that fancy footwork,

a partner for a week?

Country,"An old man was sitting at his table one day
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I coming to see her real soon I hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last

The postman was passing and picked up the note
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke
Straight up into heaven this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know",5.0,9.2

Not long ago I was,
A sad and lonely boy,
Did not know how to get better,

Then heaven up above,
Sent me a super love,
And now I'm happy forever.

No one wants to believe,
I've got a perfect love,
They say I'm just talking crazy,

But I can prove it's true,
If you'l allow me to,
Tell you 'bout my Super Lady

She's all that I could explore,
She's more than a dream,
She's my everthing

Whoever thought I would,
Be feeling half this good,
The world for me is new place,

I'll drink to happiness,
Because our love's the best,
The wine for me has a new taste,

I'll let my lady know,
I'll never let her go,
Forever I'm gonna hold on,

She said she feel's the same,
Don't wanna play no game,
Just wants our love to live on and on,

Wish I could fly to the sky,
And write out her name,

Climb to the top of the world,
And loudly exclaim,
She's my everything

You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.

I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again

Because she is my girlfriend insanity
When in the deeper of the night
She enters in my bed
Inside of me
Like a chilly scar
It's opening again
'Cause humanize a dream's exciting
That's all she let me know
In one second

Her unforgiving touch
Is like a blade writhing in a flower
Undressing my meaning, 
I'm discovering the taste of love
Because she is my girlfriend insanity

I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya girl you think your so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

Where do they go? God only knows

I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta
Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-

Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya

Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull
Pull another one out uhhh

[Verse 2:]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my
It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep
Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat

But I'd tried to stay wide awake
Cause you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?
Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da
Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta
Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water
Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand

When my heart is still with you,

And ol' midnight knows it, too.

Does it mean that our love is ending.

You're out of my heart,

Spinning dizzily down on the ground

But you're just like your father
Buried deep under the water
You're resting on your laurels
And stepping on my toes

What side is this anyways?

Jazz,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me

Country,"(Michael McDonald)
Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love

I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love

Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair

But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love",8.75,5.285714285714286
Country,"(Tony Joe White)
Before you go and walk out on me
Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.
And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.",3.5714285714285716,8.76

Rap,"Slowly and steadily MC's are fallin off like leprosy
Instead build immunity and spread insight through community
These fundamentals, form the krux of longevity
When melodies are looped and vocals harmonize in unity
Now its 99 and aint a damn thing changed
Some seek fame as wealth manipulates the brain
Let me, paint this picture, your minds the canvas
Many claim their real and later flake like dandruff
Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words
The other 9 stick to my nikes and get rubbed out on the curb
Lets be real, we're paper chasin' for financial backing
But theres a thin line defined by need and greed many are passing
Known as crossing over for exposure some embark
Or cars,jewels and shit that wont exist when we depart
Crews, don't snooze, or eyes become bruised

This goes out to those that slept knew the deal or were confused..
Check the blueprint..

And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills..

So respect the architect as we begin to build

Clutchin my pen tight strugglin to portray the right depiction
I'm punchin the wall of writers block, loathing for recognition
Nowadays your not heard, unless your posing an image
With watered down lyrics that appeal to most who listen
Instead i'll water the roots so branches will replenish
Expanding elements that pioneers started building
Hiphop houses, so many free loading MC's
I feel theres only a few tenants who've been paying their fees
360 degrees what goes around comes back
I'm smoking mics as I inhale lies and exhale facts
Unfold the blueprints, the plans for improvement
Bridging gaps between the mind, ball point pen and the clueless
Innovation is useless once you forget the essence
So respect the architect. pick up your pens and start sketchin
Pick up your pens and start sketching..

And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills

So respect the architect as we begin to build

As I open my slanty eyes to this place called earth
I contemplate how music has lost artistic worth
And I'm shrivled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing
With bags under my eyes on account of too much sleeping
Because of these lies in rap that I can't feel
Leaving me dazed with the phrase ""i keep it real""
How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears
I'd rather be fed in the mouth, to shit it out from the rear
Claiming their underground but underwater their wrinkling
And me like water buoys to that level I'm never sinking
Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lispin'
Then when finished biting them, find your front teeth missing
I see em sippin fine wines in spas, to match their image
Gimmicks.. I flap my jaws and their squads diminished
I don't mess with glocks but metaphorically in speech
I'd like to pump em' with more shots than diabetics receive
Then in a better place may they peacefully rest
In hopes that next time the blueprints they'll manifest
Check the blueprint...

Rock,"Now, if you can imagine this, the whole world sharing one big kiss
These are thoughts all through my brain, that I daydream everyday
That I'm alive and well, and right now, I'm alive, I'm feeling...well
It's my life to live my way, so I'll keep daydreaming away
And who knows, maybe someday, it will all come true
And I will get my way, and we will live as one

I'm caught up in a dream, I'm gonna wish for it all
No one's gonna tell me how, no way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing, no way, it's my dream

And what cannot will be done, for every living thing under the sun
Forget color, forget race, and just be one big happy face
Among this sea of people, live among God's creatures, sharing love
That was sent down from above, here to share with one another
Father, brother, sister, mother, everybody sharing love, sharing love

I'm caught up in a dream, I'm gonna wish for it all
No one's gonna tell me how, no way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing, no way, it's my dream, this is my dream

What if...I close my eyes and everything will be alright
Here in my fantasy, living in harmony
Make my dream come alive

I'm caught up in a dream, I'm gonna wish for it all
No one's gonna tell me how, no way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing, no way, it's my dream

No one's gonna tell me how, no way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems simply impossible

Jazz,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Country,"(Feat. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson) 
I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",6.75,8.555555555555555
Punk,"So, I guess by now, You're already cool.
Nothing like earlier today,
when I thought that all the things
that you had said...
You just got carried away.
How do you return from a weekend like this?
This is a fucked up holiday. 
I'm feeling confused.
I'm feeling, not mislead...
But like i'm just a fool.

And if you say it now,
there are already roses on our grave.

I've never counted on the road quite like this.
It's the only solid thing today.
Cause i'm just holding on,
hardly awake, so mixed up in everything.

Somehow it seems
We've shed our dream but we're

Out of the blue, suddenly you were there


Wherever I go you're the glow of temptation,

Glancing my way in the grey of the dawn

And always your smile holds that strange invitation

Then you are gone

Where oh where have you gone



How long must I live in a world of illusion

Be where you are so near yet so far, apart

Hoping you'll say with a sweet invitation

Where have you been, darling come in

But before you write me up 
let me tell you the reason.
I wasn't tryin' to out run you,
I was chasin' a guy who outta

back about a mile or two.

I was crusin' along, when he 
pulled up outta no where.
He was hotter than the truck
he drove, and just one lane over.
He aimed those angel eyes at me, 
smiled like we were ment to be.
'For he stole my heart from a
moving car.

It was highway robbery, He 
grabbed my heart and took 
off on the run.

turn your blue light on and
help me catch that bandit.

get away scott free, for it's

But if you take a little time you are sure to find it
We complicate something so basic

Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game

I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe

There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph

Put down your sword and crown
Come lay with me on the ground

Spastic and violently
Whipping me into a storm
Shaking me down to the core

And you've left me shimmering
Like diamond wedding rings
Spinning dizzily down on the ground

Somethin' didn't feel quite right

It left his brain
Feelin' a tad bit sour
When the pompous ones arrived
He was barely alive
She'd sucked him dry of all his power

Dont say that you've not been told
She'll know the ivory off your tower
Then she'll glower

Cause to fearless fungus friends

Hundred piled corpses
Mixed with those alive, a rotten mess
Penetrated by death

In sludge of body parts crawl those who still breathe
Cold dead corpses
Crushed beneath still screaming bodies
Bowels gushed from wounds

Stream into pools of blood
Floats into a sea of death

Dead or buried alive
The skin burst underground
Suffocated by a hundred corpses
Broken bodies decompose

Stream into pools of blood
Floats into a sea of death",3.4,4.9411764705882355

Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I coming to see her real soon I hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last

I`ve lost my path

While I found an answer
A wall of questions
Stood up on my way
THen,an evening
While I was doubtful
Of my own life
I dived into the light

Is it a dream or reality
Do I exist?
Is it the end of beginning
I`ve lost my soul

Porter of divine knowledge
Is only power and light

Just to figure out you weren't dreaming in the first place

Coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung ta
Claim ta, unrolled myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap
I'm amongst tha
Streets deceiving
Can't believe my achievements

Persona's that of a non-needer
Because I don't need nada except for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
To my g's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix
Caked up, tryna take what I'm eating
Came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy mouth
Wild, hardly
A man's man
Who woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebel's and Stella McCartney's
For years, all that
How could I not be dead
This old German
Said I was a thug with a notty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see
From my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme
My stories is I'm from the home of the thieves

The lord is a g, he gotta be
Who's the God of suckers and snitches
The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe
Blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive
Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder
Black cop cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers, athletes, and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances, trends, and fashion
But when it comes to residuals, they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tee's, blue jeans, and red bandanas

Killed indigenous people
Built a new nation
Involuntary labor
Took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby

And tell the whole government

Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron

Brighter than tomorrow 
And if you really try 
You'll Find There's No Need 
To Cry 
In This Place You'll Feel 
There's No Hurt Or Sorrow 

There are ways 
To get there 
If you care enough 
For the living 
Make a little space 
Make a better place

Chorus: 
Heal the world 
Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
And the entire human race 
There are people dying 
If you care enough 
For the living 
Make a better place 
For you and for me 

If you want to know why 
There's a love that cannot lie 
Love is strong 
It only cares for joyful giving 

If we try 
We shall see 
In this bliss we cannot feel 
Fear or dread 
We stop existing and start living 

Then it feels that always 
Love's enough for us growing 
make a better world 
Make a better world

Chorus 

And the dream we were conceived in 
Will reveal a joyful face 
And the world we once believed in 
Will shine again in grace 

Then why do we keep strangling life 
Wound this earth 
Crucify it's soul 
Though it's plain to see 
This world is heavenly 
Be God's glow 

We could fly so high 
Let our spirits never die 
In my heart 
I feel you are all my brothers 

Create a world with no fear 
Together we'll cry happy tears 
See the nations turn their swords 
Into plowshares 

We could really get there 
If you cared enough for the living 
Make a little space 
To make a better place

Chorus (x3)

There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make a better place 
For you and for me (x2)

The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh

Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya girl you think your so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows

3-5-4-4
I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta
Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-
-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy widea
Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya
I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilda
Impregnate a lesbian, yea now let's see ya have triplets and I'll di-
-sintegrate them babies, as soon as they out hoe, with formalde-
-hyde in cyanide girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louda
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun out of

Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalpa
Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull
Pull another one out uhhh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my
It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep
Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
But I'd tried to stay wide awake
Cause you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?
Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da
Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta
Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water
Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand
Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that
What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

[Verse One: Inspectah Deck]
Ryzarector, Madman, uh, uhh, yo, uhh
I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I lived, a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, C-cypher power stalk plus the fiend talk
Three G's accost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisonin the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blastin
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened, shhhh
Trapped in deep-water gaspin
I Clash With the Titans from my half on the action

[Verse Two: RZA]
I stop producers careers, the weak spot was their ears
Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still peeled it still they're living built tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body has a tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches
Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable
Interchangable, caution flameable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable, angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retrieve through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

[Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef]
(Assassination day)
First of all, before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon
Don, spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurgin, mergin in the suburbs, using this just like an adverb
Action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aimin like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pah
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Hold on like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high
Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shootin it like they blew top snow
You won't play me like your lady
Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby
Final destination Haiti

[Verse Four: Masta Killa]
War is extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in 
Murdereous rhymin, constantly in climbin
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback...

brings a blackened sky to fall
and make you very cold
while you grow old

Gone whithout a trace (gone)

and left in tyranny

you're not alone
they've took your breath of life
and left your mind to unfold
lifeless and cold

it hides the scars of love

We've hit black ice and lost control.
We're spinning faster now.
Tell me are we flying? Are we falling to the ground?
If tomorrow doesn't come, did we die for nothing?

Recounting past events has helped reveal that you don't give a damn 
about the days when you would live the words you wrote.
Not the person who you were; I hate the person you've become.
You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing.

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

You said you started up this home 
because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run.
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.
If you had then where were you?
We've payed our dues without you.

Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?
Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through.
I am nothing like you!

It feels like I'm watching my whole world crash

Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's

Never did we want it more.
Take my actions not as habits.
Those which are not justified.
Lead me to the one who cares.
Show me how to feel alive.

Tonight we die together.

I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-
And I was crying on the staircase-
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,

So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.

Cris' like the diamonds in the watch on my wrist
Audiences growing like a newborn
You must be on some new and improved

Tell me, who wanna mo'
Catch me in the studio, what? Doing a do

Spendin' money ain't nuthin'
Nigga's who style frontin'
And then pretend ya gettin' old
Nigga, we let you know, diamond district
Platinum Rolex's with the chips in it
Money to burn, nigga when will you learn
It's automatic, now I realize I gotta have
Lifestyles of the rich, that fly assed bitch
There's a track to be ripped, I got the hot shit
Check the whip, I'm banging from my land to my six
Had you screamin' at the show saying Bassey's a hit
I got the gift and nigga's know I'm ready for this
Eyes closed, lips sealed, and prepare for the kiss

Where did we lose our way
Girl, it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be?
Oh, God, give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes to face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be?
Oh, God, give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby, I'm sorry
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers
The blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go

You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It'll heal all things
It won't hurt any more
No, I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees
Begging you please
Come home

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be?
Oh, God, give me the reason
I'm down on bended—down on bended knee

Wanna build a new life
Just you and me
Gonna make you my wife
Raise a family

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to work
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

Right down to the wire, even through the fire

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall

For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way

Rap,"I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's
Cause they don't make no songs like these

And I was thinkin' about you.

You hold my hand, but do you really need me?
I guess it's time for me to let you go,

Oh! Will you never set me free?

Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

A tearless stare
encased by fear
like a thread my heart is torn
and ripped right from my soul
with no control

Suits in disguise then fades to red
brings a blackened sky to fall
and make you very cold
while you grow old

Gone whithout a trace (gone)
it's left me chained and bound
my heart you thrust a dagger
my life and dreams are shattered
and left in tyranny

Rapture or pain
you spill my blood and take my life away
rapture or pain
all adversions still remain

You've realized
you're not alone
they've took your breath of life
and left your mind to unfold
lifeless and cold

Your thoughts erased
it's death you taste
your searing face
it hides the scars of love

Gone whithout a trace (gone)
it's left me chained and bound
my heart you thrust a dagger
my life and dreams are shattered
and left in tyranny

Rapture or pain
you spill my blood and take my life away
rapture or pain
all adversions still remain

""Is this the day?""

I alone have heard this lovely strain
I alone have heard this glad refrain
Must it be forever inside of me?
Why can't I let it go? Why can't I let you know?

Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing?
Beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet, and the words are true
The song is you

You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.

What do you see on the news when you watch T.V.
War in the name of God, or a playground killing spree
Politicians promise you the world, and a preacher cries
All he ever wanted was your money, and a bitch on the side
What went wrong? Did society twist him?

What do you see in the center of the public eye
Rock stars on smack, and a serial killer fries
Radicals blame suicide and murder on our from of art
Brainwash the youth, you know they claim we all play a part
What a shame that they can't think for themselves

Past tense to future tense let history unfold
So ends a decade now what will the nineties hold
You know we're verging on the edge of an age
Then another century will turn the page

What do you think they will say when they look back on this
Were the eighties just a time of spoiled innocence
We leave our legacy like dust in the sands of time
Let's hope the seeds we plant can carry the weight of our crimes

Past tense to future tense let history unfold
And when we're old and gray these stories will be told
You know we're verging on the edge of an age
Then another century will turn the page

We sail an ocean, a sea of doubt
Skeptics make no sense, can't work things out
I'll choose optimism, scream its name
Look to the future, a burning flame

Past tense to future tense let history unfold
So ends a decade now what will the nineties hold

A sad and lonely boy,
Did not know how to get better,

Then heaven up above,
Sent me a super love,
And now I'm happy forever.

No one wants to believe,
I've got a perfect love,
They say I'm just talking crazy,

But I can prove it's true,
If you'l allow me to,
Tell you 'bout my Super Lady

She's all that I could explore,
She's more than a dream,
She's my everthing

Be feeling half this good,

I'll drink to happiness,
Because our love's the best,
The wine for me has a new taste,

I'll let my lady know,
I'll never let her go,
Forever I'm gonna hold on,

Don't wanna play no game,
Just wants our love to live on and on,

Wish I could fly to the sky,
And write out her name,

Climb to the top of the world,
And loudly exclaim,
She's my everything

Before you go and walk out on me
Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.
And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.",3.5714285714285716,8.76

Maybe its not just down to you
oh god can we win back what we have lost
To who's the lost resort, Oh God

Tumbling towards unclear destinations
Do they wash away the flames the wind and the searing rains
As our powers interchange

Oh God can we win back what we have lost
To who's the lost resort, oh God

I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender

Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta

Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya

She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep
Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy

I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat

Cause you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take

Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?
Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars

Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta
Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water
Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand

Stealth sovereign reaper

Probing vomits for more 

Caight in unbridled suspense

Ah había una vez, una pareja desprovista poca vista sin dinero
Pensando atónito, tónico, crónico como vivir
Salir del negro fango que le ahogaba
Tramaban, andaban, entre besos una cámara silente

Country,"(Feat. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson) 
I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",6.75,8.555555555555555

Claim ta, unrolled myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap

Can't believe my achievements

Because I don't need nada except for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
To my g's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix
Caked up, tryna take what I'm eating
Came up a dismissive kid

Said I was a thug with a notty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see

From crime to rhyme
My stories is I'm from the home of the thieves

Assassinations
Diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people
Built a new nation
Involuntary labor
Took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby
Let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700's
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite
Through your covenant
Love to sit in on the Senate
And tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair
She read about herself in the bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron
Like bring me my dinner, dear
She the nigger here
Ain't we in the free world
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls
Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casually
Bugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me
How far we really from third world savagery

We all have ways of finding out the things we don't know

Well I can breathe it in and see the darkness all around
I see things every day in every way
Unleashed unchained and unrestrained so I can say
the death and hate I see I'll bring it to the ground
I can breathe it in and bring entire systems down

Break through baby I've never felt this good
Because I know I've seen what the others should have to see
Who left the light in these blinded eyes?
Street wise soldier I always thought I would bring back
the fight our mothers and fathers could
They rocked the system and changed their lives

I turned my face away
it's the only way to see what I am
so I don't have to breathe

And now I see the sights I had on the are now on me
Tell me when did I go wrong?
Have I been this heartless and selfish and fucked up all along?
How did lose proof?
Did I forget to reach the youth and expose the truth?
But now instead of all the things I thought I shed
The only thing I can really see is that I am already dead

Country,"You know, I worked the Big Packet show in Fort Worth, Saturday night, 
We had all day Sunday to rest and relax, before I caught another flight. 
So I decided to walk down town an' get myself a little fresh air. 
Before long, I found myself in front of a big church on the corner of the square. 
Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound. 
So I just walked up the steps an' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down. 
But before I could, a young man walked over to me an said: ""Excuse me, Sir, 
""But I can't let you in with that big black hat, those jeans, that beard an' long hair. 

So I just left, went back outside, sat down on that kerbing, an I thought to myself: 
That's the house of the Lord. That guy's got the hell of a nerve. 
Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please. 
So right there, in front of that Church, I just knelt down on my knees. 

I said: ""Lord, I know I don't look like much, but I didn't think you'd mind. 
""I just wanted to be with your people, Lord: it's been a long time. 
""A while ago, a saw a wino over there in the alley, all bent over in tears, 
""An' I thought how one stained glass window, from this Church, would feed his family for years."" 

""Then there's those fine cars parked outside: too many for me to count. 
""Made me think how people walked for days to hear your sermon on the mount. 
""Then there's those fine ladies in the choir, Lord, singin' like they really love it. 
""Hell, last night, they were dancin' on the front row of my show: drinkin' beer, screamin: 'Sing Shove It.' 

""You know, even John the Baptist wouldn't be welcome in this place, 
""With his coat made of Camel hair an' sandals on his feet an' a long beard on his face. 
""You know, Lord, when you come back to get your children, an' take 'em beyond the clouds, 
""To live forever in Heaven with you: well, I'd sure hate to be in this crowd. 

""You know, Lord, I'm not perfect; some even call me no count. 
""But I'll tell you: I believe a man is judged by what's in his heart, not what's in his bank account. 
""So if this is what religion is: a big car, a suit an' a tie, 
""Then I might as well forget it Lord, 'cause I can't qualify. 

""Oh, by the way, Lord, right before they kicked me out, didn't I see a picture of you? 
""With sandals an' a beard. Believe you had long hair too."" 
""Well, this is Paycheck, signing off.

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,

Memories always start 'round midnight

Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,

When my heart is still with you,

And ol' midnight knows it, too.

When a quarrel we had needs mending,

Does it mean that our love is ending.

Darlin' I need you, lately I find

You're out of my heart,

And I'm out of my mind.



Let our hearts take wings'

'round midnight, midnight

Let the angels sing,

for your returning.

Till our love is safe and sound.

And old midnight comes around.

When people get married they always have a dance
The music is grand with a samba band
The people are carried away with such romance

Olay! Olay! The Wedding Samba

Will bring a pretty senorita to her feet

And when they play The Wedding Samba

She'll say ""I do"" and seal it with a samba beat



So that's how it goes in fiesta time

The beat of a samba is always in the air

And every one knows it's fiesta time

And joins in the samba around the happy pair",1.3,7.615384615384615

A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

This is The Fallen

This is the last time you will have us.
You're lawless and purely dishonest.
A scandal that we have funded for you.
Make no mistake this all is about you.

No, we never knew.
(This is the last time you will have us.)
Don't buy what they sell you.
(You're lawless and purely dishonest.)
No, we never knew.
(A scandal that we have funded for you.)
Don't buy what they sell you.
(Make no mistake this all is about you.)

But I can't stop feeling love for this place we both came from. 
I will never lose my youth.
All of this is too unforgettable.

Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling...

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.",3.7333333333333334,7.803571428571429

RnB,"If you were meant to be together
Then you would know that it's right
After all this time, you'd be by his side
And if it were meant to be forever
You'd still be living in that dream
So it seems

So for all the times you cried
And the many times he lied
I'll tell you 'cause I know
You can make it on your own

So your heart belongs to you now
And you know that it's right
Free from that make believe love story
In your mind (in your mind, in your mind)
Feel so much better, leaving yesterday behind
But always remember, hold on to life

So for all of your regrets
That your poor heart won't let you forget
I can tell you 'cause I know
You can make it on your own

You'll be wiser in the morning
So much stronger when the sun rises
So don't find your fear alarming
Your pain will disappear like nightfall
Will then rain comes, the pain goes
Wash it away
The remains of a battered soul
Trouble won't' last always
Believe me there'll be brighter days

So for all the time you cried (every single tears)
Every single time you tried
I know cause I know cause I know
You can make it on your own",5.5,6.636363636363637

She's been left out, and she can't relate,
It doesn't matter what we say.
Cause I know we may fall down,
It's safe to lay down or run away,
She said for now that she will remain my if I stay.

She's losing out and I'm feeling so down,
And out with myself,
It doesn't matter we will change.. our world.

We may fall down,
It's safe to lay down or run away,

The beast of hell is here
He's come to rule the Earth
They will obey his power
A serpent Rises
Rise abive the Earth
Followed by an army
An army of the immortal

An army of the dead

Secretly they can arrive
The enemy is fire
Ripped from their sight
Falling through the sky
The enemy immortal

Never die

Here is wisdom and faith
No one stand and beg for
The number of the beast released
A number of a man is his number
Six hundred and sixty six, 666

He's risen from the sea
The beast of hell is here
Come to rule the world
And you will be in fire

Surtur is risen, Surtur is here
Repent youtself, he'll rule the world
Surtur is risen, Surtur is here
Repent yourself, he'll rule the world
Rule the world!

Surtur is risen, Surtur is here
Repent youtself, he'll rule the world
Surtur is risen, Surtur is here
Repent yourself, he'll rule the world

You and me; we fell in love with each other last night
I told you I was concerned
You told me of your concerns, too
Yet and still we both decided
To make love last night
Baby, please tell me

Where do we go from here my love
What are we doing baby
Boy you gotta let me know
Why can't we live the way we want
I want the world to know
I just gotta let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together
Is what we choose
Oh my love
I think that we should talk
About us

Could this be a crazy dream
And if so then you're dreaming too
'Cause I know for sure that
You feel the same as I do
Could it be that we could be wrong
Even though we're feeling so right
I don't care because I know
That I want you tonight
And I know you want me too

You've lost that look in your eye.
The one that told me everything was fine without a word.
But now we're standing face to face,
with nothing left to say but goodbye to yesterday.
I don't know if I can make it.
I don't know if I'm that strong.
I don't know where we went wrong but somehow it's over.
In my mind I see you clearly.
In my dreams I feel you near me.
I want to know, does this feeling go away?

Like shooting stars we shine and then we fade,
breaking the promises we made.
What about the promises?
What about the promises we made?
What about our plans for forever?
Did they scare you?
Did you need to get away?

You taught me many things.

it feels like a part of you is missing.

Jazz,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Rap,"Buy now, I kill for a living
Buy now, I kill for a living
I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock

Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score
This is what you have been killed for
Dancing on the kill floor

Contrast bohemia to my workplace
When I'm racing in carpool lane
to sell shit to an art school lame
-Don't you think you're hot shit
Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number
Buy now
You pasty Brits
Buy now
You crazy chicks
Buy
Cuz I don't pay attention to rules,
regulations or safety tips
Love us
Eligible bachelors
Love us
Cuz we're the Blowed rappers
Loved
Cuz I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars
This is what you have been billed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

Lying in the bed you are so much to be without

And is longer than before
And nothing really matters anymore

It's so hard to be without you
You used to for saying how only I feel hungry
Stinging from the storm inside my ribs where it thunders
Nothing left to say or even really wonder

We're like a book
Every page is so torn
Nothing really matters anymore

It's so hard not to call you
Thunders in my bones
Out on the streets
Where I first saw you

Everything was new and colorful
It's gotten darker
Every day is a lesson things went right before
And nothing really matters anymore

It's so hard to be without you
Everyday I find another little thread of silver
Waiting for me when I wake some place on the pillow
And then I see the empty space beside me and remember

Punk,"Get me out of here.
This isn't slowing down.
We've hit black ice and lost control.
We're spinning faster now.
Tell me are we flying? Are we falling to the ground?
If tomorrow doesn't come, did we die for nothing?

Recounting past events has helped reveal that you don't give a damn 
about the days when you would live the words you wrote.
Not the person who you were; I hate the person you've become.
You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing.

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

You said you started up this home 
because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run.
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.
If you had then where were you?
We've payed our dues without you.

Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?
Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through.
I am nothing like you!

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

This is The Fallen

This is the last time you will have us.
You're lawless and purely dishonest.
A scandal that we have funded for you.
Make no mistake this all is about you.

No, we never knew.
(This is the last time you will have us.)
Don't buy what they sell you.
(You're lawless and purely dishonest.)
No, we never knew.
(A scandal that we have funded for you.)
Don't buy what they sell you.
(Make no mistake this all is about you.)

But I can't stop feeling love for this place we both came from. 
I will never lose my youth.
All of this is too unforgettable.

Yep
Follow me (Follow me)
Come with me to the dark side of the force (force)
No man would vote for your to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh

[Chorus:]
Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya girl you think your so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
(Stay wide awake) A world so cold, a world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake) But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

[Verse 1:]
3-5-4-4
I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta
Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-
-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy widea
Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya
I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilda
Impregnate a lesbian, yea now let's see ya have triplets and I'll di-
-sintegrate them babies, as soon as they out hoe, with formalde-
-hyde in cyanide girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louda
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun out of
Mur-derin I'd rather go 'vrinn-vrinn' and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalpa
Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull
Pull another one out uhhh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my
It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep
Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
But I'd tried to stay wide awake
Cause you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?
Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da
Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta
Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water
Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand
Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that
What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

Country,"See the ruin on the hill, where the smoke is hanging still,
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,

Ryzarector, Madman, uh, uhh, yo, uhh
I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I lived, a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, C-cypher power stalk plus the fiend talk
Three G's accost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisonin the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blastin
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened, shhhh
Trapped in deep-water gaspin
I Clash With the Titans from my half on the action

[Verse Two: RZA]
I stop producers careers, the weak spot was their ears
Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still peeled it still they're living built tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body has a tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches
Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable
Interchangable, caution flameable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable, angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retrieve through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

[Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef]
(Assassination day)
First of all, before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon
Don, spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurgin, mergin in the suburbs, using this just like an adverb
Action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aimin like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pah
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Hold on like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high
Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shootin it like they blew top snow
You won't play me like your lady
Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby
Final destination Haiti

[Verse Four: Masta Killa]
War is extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in 
Murdereous rhymin, constantly in climbin
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback...

With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir

Country,"We were both young, when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-
And I was crying on the staircase-
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, Oh.

Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -
but you were everything to me-
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes-

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Oh, Oh.

I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say... yes.

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

[Exodus 31:34, Deuteronomy 5:7]
Bring us your trinkets, your baubles of gold
Join the debauchery, the young and the old
Let us bow down to his great golden calf
Darken our spirits, as we dance and we laugh

The golden calf takes shape - the idol of black hearts
The whole deed, from the sum of its parts
From the healer of sorrow came a great molten blast
With holy tongue of fire, the commandments were cast

Down from the mountain with two tablets of stone
In countenanc white, Moses walked down alone
Instructed by God to bring the people His word
Intoxicated by evil, their judgment obscured
Why should we listen to his set of his rules ?
Deeper in sin sinks the assembly of fools

Though shalt not make graven images
Visiting evil in the land of the dust
Though shalt not have other gods before Me
Then only then can you truly be free

Let us bow down to the King of kings
Melt down this idol and the evil it brings",4.4,8.181818181818182

Three G's accost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter

The earth daughter rest her head on my chest

Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears

Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches
Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable
Interchangable, caution flameable

Retrieve through your doors

Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay

Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat

take your leave
do as you please

One kiss, then I continue again Walkin' my baby back home.She 'fraid of the dark, so I have to park Outside of her door till it's light She says if I try To kiss her, she'll cry I dry her tears all through the night.

Though it's plain to see 
This world is heavenly 
Be God's glow

Let our spirits never die

See the nations turn their swords 
Into plowshares

All pretensions disappear
Now our impulses will bite
At the ankles of our fear

No man would vote for your to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh

Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya girl you think your so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
(Stay wide awake) A world so cold, a world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake) But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta
Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-
-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy widea
Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya
I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilda
Impregnate a lesbian, yea now let's see ya have triplets and I'll di-
-sintegrate them babies, as soon as they out hoe, with formalde-
-hyde in cyanide girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louda
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun out of

Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalpa
Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull
Pull another one out uhhh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my
It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep
Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
But I'd tried to stay wide awake
Cause you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?
Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da
Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta
Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water
Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand
Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that
What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

Country,"We were both young, when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-
And I was crying on the staircase-
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, Oh.

Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -
but you were everything to me-
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes-

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Oh, Oh.

I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say... yes.

Country,"Misty sunrise in my hometown
Rows of cotton 'bout knee high
Mrs. Baker down the dirt road
Still got clothes out on the line
Erwin Nichols there with Judge Lee
Playin checkers at the gin
When I dream about the southland,
This is where it all begins

From Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll tide roll
Muddy water, Misssissippi,
Blessed Graceland whispers to me,
Carry on, carry on,
Sweet southern comfort
Carry on

Catchin catfish on the river
Chasin fireflies by the creek
Kissin Gary William's sister,
On the porch Homecomin' week,
With rusty cars and weeping willows,
Keepin' watch out in the yard
Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie
Could be anywhere you are,

In Carolina or in Georgia
Open arms are waitin for ya,
Louisianna yellow rose of San Antone
Arkansas, Mississippi,
Old man river whispers to me,
Carry on, carry on,
Sweet southern comfort
Carry on

As I sit here I'm surrounded
By these priceless memories
I don't have to think about it
There's no place I'd rather be

In Carolina or in Georgia,
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll tide roll
Muddy water, Misssissippi,
Blessed Graceland whispers to me,
Carry on, carry on,

Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I coming to see her real soon I hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last

The postman was passing and picked up the note
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke
Straight up into heaven this letter did go

Let the present lead. Head my inner bleed.

My acts of foolishness. Victimize the perpetual soil.

to see if it's all true. Confide in me.

Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?

Hole in the glass to feel it all

I want to scream
Clenched fist, ground teeth

Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel
All of the sudden it feels so real
The bang, the smoke, the blood

Jump to the car, start it to the floor and while the engine's still in a 
roar slap it it drive
And leave behind a trail of anger a path to find

Never hit the ground, rising above
Looking down on you, down on the heads of the damned
Marching all right through into the crowd

Talking to him but she ain't hearing a thing
If you were smart you'd turn around and let her go

That girls' a Barbie doll

She's real good-looking but she's got no heart at all

She puts on her makeup and drives to the bar in her
Boyfriend's old man's brand-new car
She's got no idea what she does or why

She does whatever she wants I guess
Whatever comes first or whatever looks best
Nobody I know has ever seen her cry

You should have seen her last Saturday night
She had a friend of mine treating her right
She was hanging on him until she found a better deal

Something we fall short of

But if you take a little time you are sure to find it
We complicate something so basic 
But once you taste it you gonna chase it like me

'86 submarine
Someone's behind me in an escalade trying to blind me with their high beams

I feel warm inside

Put your picture on my dashboard 'till my fate and yours collides

And watch the price of gasoline rise with the price of fame

Check your engine, looks like you're running on the blood of Indians
Put some turquoise in that Rolls Royce before you crash into a pendulum

Felt like a little kid hiding in my mothers' dress

The lone ambassador of every race
The starfish that discover me plant their flags into my face
I'm a clone of every written and unwritten poem
A shark pulls up beside me fingering beads and chanting ""Om""
I can't believe it

Get big, little kid.

doesn't quite fit the space
we saved for it.

that you throw up both your hands,
that you call it quits...

Take your midnight trip
I know you've dreamed of it.
Walk your sunset strip,
because I think you've needed it

only got this good
because of those younger days
that'd you like to outstrip.

Scared by the past
Need someone to blame
You'll never last
Put you in your place
Haunted by your face
Fear of what you are
Guilty by far

Marching for your rights
These forgotten ways
You don't realize
This time no one pays

Society, can't you see
You're no different than me
Betrayed by your own kind
Not just facts but reality

Overpopulation
They breed like rats
Standing for one nation
Under a God who laughs

Condemned, by what you've become
Criminally infested
Guilty, for all you have done

Jazz,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

Country,"Misty sunrise in my hometown
Rows of cotton 'bout knee high
Mrs. Baker down the dirt road
Still got clothes out on the line
Erwin Nichols there with Judge Lee
Playin checkers at the gin
When I dream about the southland,
This is where it all begins

From Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll tide roll
Muddy water, Misssissippi,
Blessed Graceland whispers to me,
Carry on, carry on,
Sweet southern comfort
Carry on

Catchin catfish on the river
Chasin fireflies by the creek
Kissin Gary William's sister,
On the porch Homecomin' week,
With rusty cars and weeping willows,
Keepin' watch out in the yard
Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie
Could be anywhere you are,

In Carolina or in Georgia
Open arms are waitin for ya,
Louisianna yellow rose of San Antone
Arkansas, Mississippi,
Old man river whispers to me,
Carry on, carry on,
Sweet southern comfort
Carry on

As I sit here I'm surrounded
By these priceless memories
I don't have to think about it
There's no place I'd rather be

In Carolina or in Georgia,
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll tide roll
Muddy water, Misssissippi,
Blessed Graceland whispers to me,

Sweet southern comfort,

Drifting further every day

The nightmare continues, I see through their lies

Wash it away

He got extra dope rhymes and punchlines forever. His stuff would catch in no time if his production guy was better
And there's nothing I like better than new battle lyrics. My favorite jam's Secret Agent, man. You have to hear it!
I heard it got a fat review in a mag or two, and now the majors want him. It would suck if that was true
It ain't a cat half as fat as Lou that's as true to stayin' indie, or dudes with punchlines on major labels sayin' any
He even answers all his e-mails if he's got a chance at all, and told me Ikon's real name was Vinnie

Maybe when he's gettin' chased by a bunch of sweaty faced, record snakes with chainsaws and machete blades

Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love

I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love

Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair

But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth

Where do we go from here
What do I do with these feelings
Longing to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

Why must the bad things always feel so good
Why can't I just stay away

Where do we go from here
What do I do with these feelings
Longing to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

Why must I yearn for your kiss

Reminds me how much your missed

Now i find my eyes were closed until the day i met this girl
But the moment i caught site of her
The light of her
The bright of her
I could she would be
The most beautiful thing in my life

Where she walks, the earth is greener
And the clouds all run away
And she brings a little sunshine
Into everybody's day

You know everytime she's close to me
She glows to me
Arose to me
A shining star, she is by far
The most beautiful thing in my life.

And when she gives me a smile or a touch
Who'd ever think little things mean so much.

Yesterday belongs to someone else
Today belongs to me
I guess that it's my turn at last to know
How sweet that love can be
It's thrilling love
A chilling love
An ever-warm phorphilling love

Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love

I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love

Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair

But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love",8.75,5.285714285714286

Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock

And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card

Still I, I wanna get close to you, I wanna get close to you.

[Exodus 31:34, Deuteronomy 5:7]
Bring us your trinkets, your baubles of gold
Join the debauchery, the young and the old
Let us bow down to his great golden calf
Darken our spirits, as we dance and we laugh

The golden calf takes shape - the idol of black hearts
The whole deed, from the sum of its parts
From the healer of sorrow came a great molten blast
With holy tongue of fire, the commandments were cast

Down from the mountain with two tablets of stone
In countenanc white, Moses walked down alone
Instructed by God to bring the people His word
Intoxicated by evil, their judgment obscured
Why should we listen to his set of his rules ?
Deeper in sin sinks the assembly of fools

Though shalt not make graven images
Visiting evil in the land of the dust
Though shalt not have other gods before Me
Then only then can you truly be free

Let us bow down to the King of kings
Melt down this idol and the evil it brings",4.4,8.181818181818182

Country,"See the ruin on the hill, where the smoke is hanging still,
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.",5.2,10.038461538461538

One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me

A condemned club for both weak and poor.

Let the present lead. Head my inner bleed.

Screaming fight in me.

And the silhouette was seen for miles around.

When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Withdrawn from all that I know
Disturbed by darkened thoughts
Of haunting agony, restrain the memorie

The government denies their sole existence
But it's much too late for them
Can't wait to see their faces
When they arrive again
Mental impairment, sanity lost, it's vanished away
But all I know, the men in black
Are secret spies, as the tension grows
Deep down inside, I know they're coming for me
For the 2nd time, I'm going, going away
Why am I caught in this conspiracy
Have to find a way
Don't care what it takes
I shall persevere
Tell me why it is this way

Confused in this maze, no chance to escape

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

I refuse to believe we're a dying breed
Children of peace hope and harmony
Ordinary folks extraordinary love
Something from above
Something we fall short of
You can't see with an untrained eye 
But if you take a little time you are sure to find it
We complicate something so basic 
But once you taste it you gonna chase it like me
It goes on and on ...

A - yo here we go, open up the gates and let it flow ... 
Love's gonna take us higher

It's extraordinary love",4.6,7.565217391304348

I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-
And I was crying on the staircase-
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, Oh.

Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -
but you were everything to me-
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes-

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Oh, Oh.

I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say... yes.

Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir

It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

Trickling down the baggy pant leg

I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find you
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
Didn't want no one to hold you
What does that mean?
And you said

Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
I'm running
And I won't touch ground
Oh no
I got to keep on moving

You're on a roll and now you pray it'll last
The road beyond was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason
Why you're running so fast?
And she said

Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down

Whatever..
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fuck it 
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 
in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..
I don't know you and no, 
I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
No patience is in me and if you offend me 
I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air 
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (of all you)..
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me

Chorus: Eminem

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

[Eminem]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content -
- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me (finger at me)..
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty
havin this happenin (this happenin)..
then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way)..
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire 
to burn and it's burnin and I have returned

Chorus

[Eminem]
I'm so sick and tired of bein admired
that I wish that I would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is..""
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk 
with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin 
the same fuckin questions (fuckin questions)..
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out
cause they drivin me crazy (drivin me crazy).. I can't take it 
I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for ev-ery fan that I get
But I can't take a SHIT, in the bathroom
without someone standin by it

Interchangable, caution flameable

Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat

She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep
Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
But I'd tried to stay wide awake
Cause you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?
Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da
Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta
Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water
Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand
Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that
What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

Forever united here somehow

I was crusin' along, when he

he drove, and just one lane over.
He aimed those angel eyes at me, 
smiled like we were ment to be.

Whipping me into a storm
Shaking me down to the core

Country,"See the ruin on the hill, where the smoke is hanging still,
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.",5.2,10.038461538461538

Beacuse I need that dollar every day of the weak

But man, he can suck a cock.
Rock is not The Devil's work,
It's magical and rad.
I'll never rock as long as I am stuck here with my dad

I hear you brave young Jaybles,
You are hungry for the rock.
But to learn the ancient method,
Sacred doors you must unlock.
Escape your father's clutches,
And this oppressive neighborhood.
On a journey you must go,
To find the land of Hollywood!
In The City of Fallen Angels,
Where the ocean meets the sand,
You will form a strong alliance,
And the world's most awesome band.
To find your fame and fortune,
Through the valley you must walk.
You will face your inner demons.

Maybe its not just down to you
oh god can we win back what we have lost
To who's the lost resort, Oh God

Tumbling towards unclear destinations
Do they wash away the flames the wind and the searing rains
As our powers interchange

Oh God can you tell us when its going to start
Maybe its not just down to you
Oh God can we win back what we have lost
To who's the lost resort, oh God

Oh God can you tell us when its going to stop
Maybe it's not just down to you

When people get married they always have a dance
The music is grand with a samba band
The people are carried away with such romance

Olay! Olay! The Wedding Samba

Will bring a pretty senorita to her feet

And when they play The Wedding Samba

She'll say ""I do"" and seal it with a samba beat



So that's how it goes in fiesta time

The beat of a samba is always in the air

And every one knows it's fiesta time

And joins in the samba around the happy pair",1.3,7.615384615384615

With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Mountains and valleys, and all that will come in between

So I risk it all just to be with you
And I risk it all for this life we choose

Eso te pasó por no saber que todo tiene su precio atrevido

Hey nah nah
Comenzaré yo a relatarles esta historia y no es de hadas
Leyenda que contaba chulo viejo de barrio en barrio
Boca a Boca, en la calzada
A los oídos del curioso rellenaba

Ah había una vez, una pareja desprovista poca vista sin dinero
Pensando atónito, tónico, crónico como vivir
Salir del negro fango que le ahogaba
Tramaban, andaban, entre besos una cámara silente
Para un estúpido tupido cliente
Que de vivo mira el punto de las daba
Estaba, andaba vigilando a la criolla de carnada

Eso te pasó, atrevido
Eso te pasó por no saber que todo tiene su precio atrevido
Eso te pasó por no saber, atrevido

A buscarla a la guarida vida
Pasó que en la guajira mira
Era más bruta que una mula lomo arriba

Vengo yo de tal manera

Que que que esta historia echa candela
Te la voy a hacer bien breve
Para que no te me aceleres
Oíste asere, todo lo que ella pedía
el punto la complacía y escucha lo que le decía

Todo lo que le pedía

El punto se la gastaba
Hay un vestido para ella,
Hay un vestido para ella,
Una camisa pa' mi
El punto se la gastaba

El punto se la gastaba

Roba todo lo que llama la atención
Busca a su chica, pura emoción

Que mi chica te ganabas
Ahora ves, te deje sin nada
Sin chica para bailar

Te pasó, por no pensar
Que los demás también ganan

Country,"(Feat. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson) 
I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",6.75,8.555555555555555

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Rock,"La la la aaaa
In a house
on an island
there's a tale that must be told
of our mysterious Misty Mountains
behind all the songs I wrote
lives an old man in his shadow
and they're whistling day and night
for whatever whatever its worth for
they are whistling for you and I

On a ranch in the wildness
there's a song that must be sung
about a blindfolded angel 
who never learned the right from wrong
and though I don't know enough English
to describe it's troubled mind
but for one thing I am certain 
is that it sings for you and I

And I tried so hard to figuring out 
but I guess I'm only human
I've been watching him drawing him
analysing him in every way
I could possible think of

but does not really help me
you got to sit back and enjoy
you know Ochrasy raised and betrayed him 
now he sits there all alone
with his soul and his legend and his epic melodies
they are with us when we crying
and they are with us when we bleed

Yes they are with us when we crying 
and they are with us when we bleed

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection

Hey Girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected - the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish

You make a woman go mad

Come on lets go, real slow

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día

Baila en la calle de noche

Yeah
She's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee like me 
back with the Fugees from a 3rd world country
I go back like when 'pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
I need a whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
No more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto

Quite at ease watch me glide
We shall lie side by side

Love the way you tease me, heart
Tear another layer off, love

Drawing ever closer like your heart is beating

Independence day comes when you're down
Still felt alone

The simple approach is the best
If it makes more sense than any other
It makes more sense than any other

I felt alone
A failed Blake knocked me to the ground
I still felt alone
My attempts at chivalry fell without a sound
I felt alone
So put on your new shoes and leave this town

Before you go and walk out on me
Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.
And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.",3.5714285714285716,8.76

Country,"You know, I worked the Big Packet show in Fort Worth, Saturday night, 
We had all day Sunday to rest and relax, before I caught another flight. 
So I decided to walk down town an' get myself a little fresh air. 
Before long, I found myself in front of a big church on the corner of the square. 
Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound. 
So I just walked up the steps an' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down. 
But before I could, a young man walked over to me an said: ""Excuse me, Sir, 
""But I can't let you in with that big black hat, those jeans, that beard an' long hair. 

So I just left, went back outside, sat down on that kerbing, an I thought to myself: 
That's the house of the Lord. That guy's got the hell of a nerve. 
Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please. 
So right there, in front of that Church, I just knelt down on my knees. 

I said: ""Lord, I know I don't look like much, but I didn't think you'd mind. 
""I just wanted to be with your people, Lord: it's been a long time. 
""A while ago, a saw a wino over there in the alley, all bent over in tears, 
""An' I thought how one stained glass window, from this Church, would feed his family for years."" 

""Then there's those fine cars parked outside: too many for me to count. 
""Made me think how people walked for days to hear your sermon on the mount. 
""Then there's those fine ladies in the choir, Lord, singin' like they really love it. 
""Hell, last night, they were dancin' on the front row of my show: drinkin' beer, screamin: 'Sing Shove It.' 

""You know, even John the Baptist wouldn't be welcome in this place, 
""With his coat made of Camel hair an' sandals on his feet an' a long beard on his face. 
""You know, Lord, when you come back to get your children, an' take 'em beyond the clouds, 
""To live forever in Heaven with you: well, I'd sure hate to be in this crowd. 

""You know, Lord, I'm not perfect; some even call me no count. 
""But I'll tell you: I believe a man is judged by what's in his heart, not what's in his bank account. 
""So if this is what religion is: a big car, a suit an' a tie, 
""Then I might as well forget it Lord, 'cause I can't qualify. 

""Oh, by the way, Lord, right before they kicked me out, didn't I see a picture of you? 
""With sandals an' a beard. Believe you had long hair too.""

I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-
And I was crying on the staircase-
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, Oh.

Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -
but you were everything to me-
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes-

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Oh, Oh.

I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say... yes.

Will expend like 45's with compact discs (c'mon)
It's a disappointment to see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed
When I'm one of rap's anointed
Who else used to order it all on the dick
Like when I come through with spinners on the six
And got bitches bouncin like Ronnie in Tricks
But some whores in this game really don't make sense

Cause I don't love these hoes

The way I bang the heater out the back of the Hummer
The bull just move like runners from city block to city block
Layin down the foundation for what's really hot

I'm like slugs when they pierce the metal, you see sparks (what)

Don't make me run up on ya, put a few in ya

It's hard to get done, I'm hearin that security runs
around 30K, if they don't get hit with an AK
And found out that the security's runnin another way
Like with me, it's Murder, probably

'86 submarine
Someone's behind me in an escalade trying to blind me with their high beams

The sun is setting in my chest
I feel warm inside

Fuck the game, I practice being in the passing lane
And watch the price of gasoline rise with the price of fame
I'm immortal
I render unto Caesar to be cordial
He sees a wooden casket where I see a glowing portal
Check your engine, looks like you're running on the blood of Indians
Put some turquoise in that Rolls Royce before you crash into a pendulum

Felt like a little kid hiding in my mothers' dress
I'm in space
The lone ambassador of every race
The starfish that discover me plant their flags into my face
I'm a clone of every written and unwritten poem
A shark pulls up beside me fingering beads and chanting ""Om""
I can't believe it
I never really thought that sharks would need it
I thought they'd made their peace: bite it, bleed it, kill it, eat it

A dark light's entering the church
By pale glass windows
and I feel so cold

I can't stop looking at the wooden box placed
In the very centre of the nave

...sleeping

We're in the home
Of life and death
Where each being takes end
And time flows with the sand!

We cry as one
Your friends, your family
Death has stained this day
And now he's gone away

I think you would be smiling
Listening to this priest today
Before his church
I can still remember
Your songs about Christendom and stovery

I can't realise!
Death before my eyes!
Listening to this sermon's lies!

He's never seen you!
He's never talked to you!
How can his white lies be true?

But I have to understand
This prayer that pays tribute too
It's not here to be true, but help us go through
The deep pain that we bear, the way we all suffer
Our dreams of paradise get the pain out of our minds.

Country,"You know, I worked the Big Packet show in Fort Worth, Saturday night, 
We had all day Sunday to rest and relax, before I caught another flight. 
So I decided to walk down town an' get myself a little fresh air. 
Before long, I found myself in front of a big church on the corner of the square. 
Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound. 
So I just walked up the steps an' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down. 
But before I could, a young man walked over to me an said: ""Excuse me, Sir, 
""But I can't let you in with that big black hat, those jeans, that beard an' long hair. 

So I just left, went back outside, sat down on that kerbing, an I thought to myself: 
That's the house of the Lord. That guy's got the hell of a nerve. 
Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please. 
So right there, in front of that Church, I just knelt down on my knees. 

I said: ""Lord, I know I don't look like much, but I didn't think you'd mind. 
""I just wanted to be with your people, Lord: it's been a long time. 
""A while ago, a saw a wino over there in the alley, all bent over in tears, 
""An' I thought how one stained glass window, from this Church, would feed his family for years."" 

""Then there's those fine cars parked outside: too many for me to count. 
""Made me think how people walked for days to hear your sermon on the mount. 
""Then there's those fine ladies in the choir, Lord, singin' like they really love it. 
""Hell, last night, they were dancin' on the front row of my show: drinkin' beer, screamin: 'Sing Shove It.' 

""You know, even John the Baptist wouldn't be welcome in this place, 
""With his coat made of Camel hair an' sandals on his feet an' a long beard on his face. 
""You know, Lord, when you come back to get your children, an' take 'em beyond the clouds, 
""To live forever in Heaven with you: well, I'd sure hate to be in this crowd. 

""You know, Lord, I'm not perfect; some even call me no count. 
""But I'll tell you: I believe a man is judged by what's in his heart, not what's in his bank account. 
""So if this is what religion is: a big car, a suit an' a tie, 
""Then I might as well forget it Lord, 'cause I can't qualify. 

""Oh, by the way, Lord, right before they kicked me out, didn't I see a picture of you? 
""With sandals an' a beard. Believe you had long hair too.""

Buy now, I kill for a living
I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock

Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score
This is what you have been killed for

Contrast bohemia to my workplace
When I'm racing in carpool lane
to sell shit to an art school lame
-Don't you think you're hot shit
Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number

You pasty Brits
Buy now
You crazy chicks
Buy
Cuz I don't pay attention to rules,
regulations or safety tips
Love us
Eligible bachelors
Love us
Cuz we're the Blowed rappers
Loved
Cuz I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars

California summers never end

California - you're so nice
California - your paradise

The kids are ripping up the streets
In their super cars
All night parties and loud guitars
Hot hot neighbourhoods
Its the silver sound
Wicked Hollywood goes round and round

California - you're so nice
California - your paradise",4.0,4.5
Jazz,"(Joséphine Baker)
On dit qu'au delà des mers
Là-bas sous le ciel clair
Il existe une cité
Au séjour enchanté
Et sous les grands arbres noirs
Chaque soir
Vers elle s'en va tout mon espoir

J'ai deux amours
Mon pays et Paris
Par eux toujours
Mon c?ur est ravi
Manhattan est belle
Mais à quoi bon le nier
Ce qui m'ensorcelle
C'est Paris, c'est Paris tout entier

Le voir un jour
C'est mon rêve joli
J'ai deux amours
Mon pays et Paris

Manhattan est belle
Mais à quoi bon le nier
Ce qui m'ensorcelle
C'est Paris, c'est Paris tout entier

Le voir un jour

This isn't slowing down.
We've hit black ice and lost control.
We're spinning faster now.
Tell me are we flying? Are we falling to the ground?
If tomorrow doesn't come, did we die for nothing?

Recounting past events has helped reveal that you don't give a damn 
about the days when you would live the words you wrote.
Not the person who you were; I hate the person you've become.
You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing.

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

You said you started up this home 
because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run.
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.
If you had then where were you?
We've payed our dues without you.

Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?
Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through.
I am nothing like you!

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

This is The Fallen

This is the last time you will have us.
You're lawless and purely dishonest.
A scandal that we have funded for you.
Make no mistake this all is about you.

No, we never knew.
(This is the last time you will have us.)
Don't buy what they sell you.
(You're lawless and purely dishonest.)
No, we never knew.
(A scandal that we have funded for you.)
Don't buy what they sell you.
(Make no mistake this all is about you.)

But I can't stop feeling love for this place we both came from. 
I will never lose my youth.
All of this is too unforgettable.

Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling...

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.

Do not attempt to adjust your radio, there is nothing wrong.
We have taken control as to bring you this special show.
We will return it to you as soon as you are grooving.

Welcome to station WEFUNK, better known as We-Funk,
Or deeper still, the Mothership Connection.
Home of the extraterrestrial brothers,
Dealers of funky music.
P.Funk, uncut funk, The Bomb.

Coming to you directly from the Mothership
Top of the Chocolate Milky Way, 500,000 kilowatts of P.Funk-power.
So kick back, dig, while we do it to you in your eardrums.
And me? I'm known as Lollipop Man, alias the Long-Haired Sucker.
My motto is:

Make my funk the P.Funk
I want my funk uncut (make mine the P)

Now this is what I want you all to do:
If you got faults, defects or shortcomings,
You know, like arthritis, rheumatism or migraines,
Whatever part of your body it is,
I want you to lay it on your radio, let the vibes flow through.
Funk not only moves, it can re-move, dig?
The desired effect is what you get
When you improve your Interplanetary Funksmanship.

A cab'net maker's son
His hands were meant for diff'rent work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home
And went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know
I never can repay

A quiet man of music
Denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once
But his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love thru' discipline
A thund'ring velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls
Took me years to understand

And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs thru' my instrument
And his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man

For they heard another call
One went to Chicago
And the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado
When I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose
And come to know so well

And your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom
When it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness
And the times when you got tough

Country,"We were both young, when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-
And I was crying on the staircase-
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, Oh.

Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -
but you were everything to me-
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes-

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Oh, Oh.

I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say... yes.

Country,"See the ruin on the hill, where the smoke is hanging still,
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,

Unleashed unchained and unrestrained so I can say
the death and hate I see I'll bring it to the ground
I can breathe it in and bring entire systems down

Break through baby I've never felt this good
Because I know I've seen what the others should have to see
Who left the light in these blinded eyes?
Street wise soldier I always thought I would bring back
the fight our mothers and fathers could
They rocked the system and changed their lives

I turned my face away
it's the only way to see what I am
so I don't have to breathe

And now I see the sights I had on the are now on me
Tell me when did I go wrong?
Have I been this heartless and selfish and fucked up all along?
How did lose proof?
Did I forget to reach the youth and expose the truth?
But now instead of all the things I thought I shed
The only thing I can really see is that I am already dead

Sparkle when she stars to laugh

In a little rowboat to find you

Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no

Ain't nothing gonna break-a my stride

And I won't touch ground
Oh no

The road beyond was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason
Why you're running so fast?

We all have ways of finding out the things we don't know
The path or truth some find they hear it in a sound
Well I can breathe it in and see the darkness all around
I see things every day in every way
Unleashed unchained and unrestrained so I can say
the death and hate I see I'll bring it to the ground
I can breathe it in and bring entire systems down

Break through baby I've never felt this good
Because I know I've seen what the others should have to see
Who left the light in these blinded eyes?
Street wise soldier I always thought I would bring back
the fight our mothers and fathers could
They rocked the system and changed their lives

I turned my face away
it's the only way to see what I am
so I don't have to breathe

And now I see the sights I had on the are now on me
Tell me when did I go wrong?
Have I been this heartless and selfish and fucked up all along?
How did lose proof?
Did I forget to reach the youth and expose the truth?
But now instead of all the things I thought I shed
The only thing I can really see is that I am already dead

it wasn't for the dough
a genuine fiesta -

demand their money back

Jazz,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Jazz,"Life is such a great adventure
Learn to live it as you go
No one in the world can censure 
What we do here below

Don't save your kisses, just pass them around

You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound

Who's going to know that you passed them around

A hundred years from today!

Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen

You're nearer Heaven on Mother Earth's green

If you had millions what would they all mean

A hundred years from today

So laugh and sing, make love the thing

Be happy while you may

There's always one, beneath the sun

Who's bound to make you feel that way

The moon is shining, and that's a good sign

Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine

Remember, darling, we won't see it shine

A hundred years from today

A hundred years from today



Don't save your kisses, just pass them around

You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound

Who's going to know that you passed them around

A hundred years from today!

Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen

You're nearer heaven on Mother Earth's green

If you had millions what would they all mean

Staring at the waking world

Lost in a tangle of vine

Lost in a tangle of vine 

Her arms stretch wide 
To receive a life 
And her ROOTS go deep into the BLACK EARTH for strength 
And she blooms and 

Maybe she´s just a morning glory 
Lost in a tangle of vine 
Maybe she´s just a morning glory 
Lost in a tangle of vine 

She blooms while the people sleep 
Only the TRAVELERS SEE HER 
To those who RISE with the noon day Sun 
She is a closed mystery

Than boundin on your solid ground

Wishing on an airplane
Its callin stars by name
A lonely song of freedom rings
In hope of someone listening and
So I send my feeble flare
Through the silent arctic air
Heading anywhere
Until at last i've finally found
A place to lay my anchor down

I see things every day in every way
Unleashed unchained and unrestrained so I can say
the death and hate I see I'll bring it to the ground
I can breathe it in and bring entire systems down

Break through baby I've never felt this good
Because I know I've seen what the others should have to see
Who left the light in these blinded eyes?
Street wise soldier I always thought I would bring back
the fight our mothers and fathers could
They rocked the system and changed their lives

I turned my face away
it's the only way to see what I am
so I don't have to breathe

And now I see the sights I had on the are now on me
Tell me when did I go wrong?
Have I been this heartless and selfish and fucked up all along?
How did lose proof?
Did I forget to reach the youth and expose the truth?
But now instead of all the things I thought I shed
The only thing I can really see is that I am already dead

Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I lived, a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, C-cypher power stalk plus the fiend talk
Three G's accost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisonin the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blastin
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened, shhhh
Trapped in deep-water gaspin
I Clash With the Titans from my half on the action

I stop producers careers, the weak spot was their ears
Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still peeled it still they're living built tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body has a tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches
Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable
Interchangable, caution flameable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable, angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retrieve through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pah

Hold on like bullet-proof Acuras

Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby

War is extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat

Murdereous rhymin, constantly in climbin
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback...

Yep
Follow me (Follow me)
Come with me to the dark side of the force (force)
No man would vote for your to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh

[Chorus:]
Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya girl you think your so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
(Stay wide awake) A world so cold, a world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake) But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

[Verse 1:]
3-5-4-4
I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta
Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-
-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy widea
Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya
I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilda
Impregnate a lesbian, yea now let's see ya have triplets and I'll di-
-sintegrate them babies, as soon as they out hoe, with formalde-
-hyde in cyanide girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louda
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun out of

Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalpa
Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull
Pull another one out uhhh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my
It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep
Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
But I'd tried to stay wide awake
Cause you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?
Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da
Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta
Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water
Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand
Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that
What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

Forever I'm gonna hold on,

Just wants our love to live on and on,

Whipping me into a storm
Shaking me down to the core

Spinning dizzily down on the ground

I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And I was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder,
""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""
Tangled up in blue.

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type.""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives.
Don't know how it all got started,
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road

Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear, till nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
Thunderdome

Looking for something
We can rely on
There's gotta be something better out there
Love and compassion
Their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change
Living under the fear till nothing else remains

All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond
Thunderdome

So what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Give it all or nothing

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

And you still can't let go?
I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping

Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I, I keep going right back

Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion

Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
but darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
and I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need...

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Everytime I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming
Begging, pleading
No more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I
I keep going right back

Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, Oh

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this moment
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I say...
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

Only thing I need to do is walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",6.75,8.555555555555555

We had all day Sunday to rest and relax, before I caught another flight. 
So I decided to walk down town an' get myself a little fresh air. 
Before long, I found myself in front of a big church on the corner of the square. 
Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound. 
So I just walked up the steps an' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down. 
But before I could, a young man walked over to me an said: ""Excuse me, Sir, 
""But I can't let you in with that big black hat, those jeans, that beard an' long hair. 

So I just left, went back outside, sat down on that kerbing, an I thought to myself: 
That's the house of the Lord. That guy's got the hell of a nerve. 
Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please. 
So right there, in front of that Church, I just knelt down on my knees. 

I said: ""Lord, I know I don't look like much, but I didn't think you'd mind. 
""I just wanted to be with your people, Lord: it's been a long time. 
""A while ago, a saw a wino over there in the alley, all bent over in tears, 
""An' I thought how one stained glass window, from this Church, would feed his family for years."" 

""Then there's those fine cars parked outside: too many for me to count. 
""Made me think how people walked for days to hear your sermon on the mount. 
""Then there's those fine ladies in the choir, Lord, singin' like they really love it. 
""Hell, last night, they were dancin' on the front row of my show: drinkin' beer, screamin: 'Sing Shove It.' 

""You know, even John the Baptist wouldn't be welcome in this place, 
""With his coat made of Camel hair an' sandals on his feet an' a long beard on his face. 
""You know, Lord, when you come back to get your children, an' take 'em beyond the clouds, 
""To live forever in Heaven with you: well, I'd sure hate to be in this crowd. 

""You know, Lord, I'm not perfect; some even call me no count. 
""But I'll tell you: I believe a man is judged by what's in his heart, not what's in his bank account. 
""So if this is what religion is: a big car, a suit an' a tie, 
""Then I might as well forget it Lord, 'cause I can't qualify.

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Jazz,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

You can say you've won
The nightmare's coming to an end
And I can see the sun
I know that's you haunting me
Take what you want
I don't owe you anything
Take what you want
I don't owe you anything
I know I'm not wrong
I know what you want from me

Truth will rear it's ugly head
Now that the fight is on
Cruel and brutal words you said
Then you say you're done
You're way too smart for your own good
To let you have your fun
You've walked on me, it's understood
You've run my life too long

I know that's you haunting me
Take what you want
I won't give you anything
Take what you want

I know I'm not wrong
I know I'm not wrong
I know what you want from me
Take what you want
I won't give you anything
Take what you want

Cover your face
Hide your eyes
And act like nothing's wrong
You'll need a better disguise
Though it won't be long
You always give yourself away
When you try to change your voice
But it's what you say and how you say it
That leaves me with no choice

Coming through the window, heart
Pull yourself a chair up, love
On and on and on, quiver like a reed
Let yourself a go go old one
Honour me a solo young man

Careful not to give yourself away
There is still tomorrow and a heart felt meaning
When you get that feeling you will recall
A night of love in motion

We shall lie warm inside
Quite at ease watch me glide
We shall lie side by side
Here and now talk in turn
I love the way you do so

Time is rolling on, blending with the mind
Love the way you tease me, heart
Tear another layer off, love

Listen to the stillness of the day
Drawing ever closer like your heart is beating
When I hear it beating I will recall
A night of love in motion

We shall lie warm inside
Quite at ease watch me glide
We shall lie side by side
Here and now talk in turn

I love to hear you breath and sigh
I wish to have you here within my arms again

Glancing my way in the grey of the dawn

And always your smile holds that strange invitation

Be where you are so near yet so far, apart

Hoping you'll say with a sweet invitation

Unchain my heart you're keeping

Where did we lose our way
Girl, it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be?
Oh, God, give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes to face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be?
Oh, God, give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby, I'm sorry
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers
The blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go

You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It'll heal all things
It won't hurt any more
No, I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees
Begging you please
Come home

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be?
Oh, God, give me the reason

Gonna make you my wife
Raise a family

Outside suburbia calling, everywhere,

When people get married they always have a dance
The music is grand with a samba band
The people are carried away with such romance

Olay! Olay! The Wedding Samba

Will bring a pretty senorita to her feet

And when they play The Wedding Samba

She'll say ""I do"" and seal it with a samba beat



So that's how it goes in fiesta time

The beat of a samba is always in the air

And every one knows it's fiesta time

And joins in the samba around the happy pair",1.3,7.615384615384615

down in Mexico
she had treinta margaritas
treinta years ago
her purse had just been stolen
she rad to make some cash
for fifty thousand pesos
the donkey fucked her ass

I'm so ashamed it makes me sick
my mothers box was his salt lick
human-donkey fornication
her taco is the destination

It soon became apparent
it wasn't for the dough
a genuine fiesta -
at the donkey show
the crowd would shout ""ole!""
as she nibbled on his sack
they never had a patron
demand their money back

A real freak show in the pit
the donkey's fucking my moms tits
acting like a true ranchero
dancing around a big sombrero

The donkey's name was Lucky
oh, boy, he loved to fuck
he'd get so damn excited
he'd kick and make you duck
if you want to be star
it's easy to be famous
just pull down your pants
let lucky fuck your anus

Rap,"Slowly and steadily MC's are fallin off like leprosy
Instead build immunity and spread insight through community
These fundamentals, form the krux of longevity
When melodies are looped and vocals harmonize in unity
Now its 99 and aint a damn thing changed
Some seek fame as wealth manipulates the brain
Let me, paint this picture, your minds the canvas
Many claim their real and later flake like dandruff
Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words
The other 9 stick to my nikes and get rubbed out on the curb
Lets be real, we're paper chasin' for financial backing
But theres a thin line defined by need and greed many are passing
Known as crossing over for exposure some embark
Or cars,jewels and shit that wont exist when we depart
Crews, don't snooze, or eyes become bruised

This goes out to those that slept knew the deal or were confused..
Check the blueprint..

So respect the architect as we begin to build

Clutchin my pen tight strugglin to portray the right depiction
I'm punchin the wall of writers block, loathing for recognition
Nowadays your not heard, unless your posing an image
With watered down lyrics that appeal to most who listen
Instead i'll water the roots so branches will replenish
Expanding elements that pioneers started building
Hiphop houses, so many free loading MC's
I feel theres only a few tenants who've been paying their fees
360 degrees what goes around comes back
I'm smoking mics as I inhale lies and exhale facts
Unfold the blueprints, the plans for improvement
Bridging gaps between the mind, ball point pen and the clueless
Innovation is useless once you forget the essence
So respect the architect. pick up your pens and start sketchin
Pick up your pens and start sketching..

And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills

So respect the architect as we begin to build

As I open my slanty eyes to this place called earth
I contemplate how music has lost artistic worth
And I'm shrivled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing
With bags under my eyes on account of too much sleeping
Because of these lies in rap that I can't feel
Leaving me dazed with the phrase ""i keep it real""
How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears
I'd rather be fed in the mouth, to shit it out from the rear
Claiming their underground but underwater their wrinkling
And me like water buoys to that level I'm never sinking
Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lispin'
Then when finished biting them, find your front teeth missing
I see em sippin fine wines in spas, to match their image
Gimmicks.. I flap my jaws and their squads diminished
I don't mess with glocks but metaphorically in speech
I'd like to pump em' with more shots than diabetics receive
Then in a better place may they peacefully rest
In hopes that next time the blueprints they'll manifest
Check the blueprint...

Country,"An old man was sitting at his table one day
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I coming to see her real soon I hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last

The postman was passing and picked up the note
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke
Straight up into heaven this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know",5.0,9.2

Before you go and walk out on me
Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.

Infecting the roots in an instant

An advocate documenting the loss 

Fluttering with conceit

Taunting their bereavement 

Mod round the dead 

Point fingers at the details 

Probing vomits for more 

Caight in unbridled suspense

While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings

From the alpha to the sand
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reaks of subway metal
Feather lecture journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with voices
Benefit to break room
Mummified manequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet

Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle

Been arranged, made by the farfetch from stability 
Took a heart pledge early on
Bled onto the drum doser
Plow in the metronome, home 
Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster

Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit apparently

Ok, time to buckle the fuck down 
Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin

all this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 
in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..
I don't know you and no, 
I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
No patience is in me and if you offend me 
I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air 
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (of all you)..
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me

Chorus: Eminem

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

[Eminem]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content -
- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me (finger at me)..
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty
havin this happenin (this happenin)..
then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way)..
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire 
to burn and it's burnin and I have returned

Chorus

[Eminem]
I'm so sick and tired of bein admired
that I wish that I would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is..""
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk 
with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin 
the same fuckin questions (fuckin questions)..
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out
cause they drivin me crazy (drivin me crazy).. I can't take it 
I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for ev-ery fan that I get
But I can't take a SHIT, in the bathroom
without someone standin by it
No I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

And you still can't let go?
I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping

Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering

Cause I, I keep going right back

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion

Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
but darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
and I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need...

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Everytime I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming
Begging, pleading
No more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, Oh

I'm about to break

Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, Oh

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this moment
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I say...
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

Only thing I need to do is walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Yep
Follow me (Follow me)
Come with me to the dark side of the force (force)
No man would vote for your to this place
The devil only knows of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh

[Chorus:]
Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya girl you think your so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
(Stay wide awake) A world so cold, a world where on-ly some will go
(Stay wide awake) But not return, when will they learn?
Where do they go? God only knows
(Stay wide awake)

[Verse 1:]
3-5-4-4
I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta
Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-
-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy widea
Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya
I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilda
Impregnate a lesbian, yea now let's see ya have triplets and I'll di-
-sintegrate them babies, as soon as they out hoe, with formalde-
-hyde in cyanide girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louda
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun out of

Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalpa
Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull
Pull another one out uhhh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my
It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep
Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat

[Verse 3:]
But I'd tried to stay wide awake
Cause you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?
Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da
Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta
Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water
Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand
Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that
What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

Rap,"""We'll have more news after this commercial word""
(As so it goes..)
""At least I think I was here asleep...
Is it possible, conceiveable that I sleepwalked out of my apartment
And went berzerk?""

[Aesop Rock]
In slipped rhythm
Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment
Parked in front the fan
And reminesce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand
'Tesants get the New York home game
With real life shoot-em-up action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art
Free game piece all included
I told this cat the earth was flat
He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
Brick-a-back novelty
Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed Tequilla worm future, be concerned
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the sand
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reaks of subway metal
Feather lecture journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with voices
Benefit to break room
Mummified manequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This a Malcom circus, got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you SUCKA!
I lay the Lord down upon its belly
With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk
Yelling 'Break yo'self!'
I'm the actualized data commission past penny tip jar donation
Been arranged, made by the farfetch from stability 
Took a heart pledge early on
Bled onto the drum doser
Plow in the metronome, home 
Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster
Sensation'll leave siesomgraph stabbin away on stone tablets
To sketch up out your future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
But have canceled developed, courtesy America
Land of the free base
Home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker
It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed
With dilapadated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece
A sweat a bit to make my Wookie ends meet
Pascifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate
Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit apparently
Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me'
Ok, time to buckle the fuck down 
Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You can catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process
Hence, your plight botches

I didn't even cause all that destruction
I'm sorry...so sorry""

I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-
And I was crying on the staircase-
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, Oh.

Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -
but you were everything to me-
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes-

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Oh, Oh.

I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.

Nowhere to flee, no way to run, nothing can stop your death
Survival is a fleeting dream, extinction - the only path that's left

Buy now, I kill for a living
I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock

Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

Contrast bohemia to my workplace
When I'm racing in carpool lane
to sell shit to an art school lame
-Don't you think you're hot shit
Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number

regulations or safety tips

Eligible bachelors
Love us
Cuz we're the Blowed rappers
Loved
Cuz I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars

brings a blackened sky to fall
and make you very cold
while you grow old

Gone whithout a trace (gone)
it's left me chained and bound

my life and dreams are shattered
and left in tyranny

Rapture or pain
you spill my blood and take my life away

you're not alone
they've took your breath of life
and left your mind to unfold
lifeless and cold

it's death you taste
your searing face
it hides the scars of love

Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

Roll to the rock, rock to the roll

You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's
Cause they don't make no songs like these

Rock,"My name is no-one and a thousand, but the old sages crowned me Queen Mother
I am the breath you can hear among the leaves of the trees
My sap emerges from the deep lakes flowing into the rivers and into the immense oceans
My blood, hot and violent, cleaves the grounding a blazing trail left by a fire dragon
Dark and deep is my womb where I generate any form of life
Here, the ancient learned to receive the old supreme art
I have created sprites and guardians, fools and sages to defend my original power
Hidden in a language written on stone shapes and symbols
Many where the children who worshipped my thousand faces with honour and respect
And I, good and terrible, fed them at my sacred springs with water and dragon's flash
Now I'm dying and so are all my faithful servants that men called Gods of Pagos
Now, the power of the only god hangs over me
And worse my fate will be if they forget about me
And with me the most ancient legend carried on by purest emotions will end
Follow the ancient path and don't turn to the false light
Raise your arms to heaven and you'll be protected
Let the spirit walk with your body and draw the cross in the circle
Abandon the sufferings that belong to your false nature
Love me and I will love you
Hate me and I will devour you
Descent into my crypts where the darkness of life reigns
And nourish the eternal sacred flame
Defend your brother tree and your sister stone because their lives are mine
Follow the snakes' trail
Because it will lead to me",25.0,11.32
Jazz,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Punk,"So, I guess by now, You're already cool.
Nothing like earlier today,
when I thought that all the things
that you had said...
You just got carried away.
How do you return from a weekend like this?
This is a fucked up holiday. 
I'm feeling confused.
I'm feeling, not mislead...
But like i'm just a fool.

And if you say it now,
there are already roses on our grave.

I've never counted on the road quite like this.
It's the only solid thing today.
Cause i'm just holding on,
hardly awake, so mixed up in everything.

Is our love like the wine in this glass
You drink like there's no tomorrow
So sure, it will always last
Will the memories tase sweet as they linger
Or the bitterness stay on my tongue
Is my heart half full of the love you gave me
Or my heart half empty cuz your love is gone

Your bags are all packed in the hallway
The boxes are stacked on the lawn
You kiss me goodbye just like always
And you're gone
Trembling hands or nerves of steel
Someone tell me what to feel

Is my heart half full or half empty
Is our love like the wine in this glass
You drink like there's no tomorrow
So sure, it will always last
Will the memories tase sweet as they linger

Of life and death
Where each being takes end
And time flows with the sand!

We cry as one
Your friends, your family
Death has stained this day
And now he's gone away

I think you would be smiling
Listening to this priest today
Before his church
I can still remember
Your songs about Christendom and stovery

I can't realise!
Death before my eyes!
Listening to this sermon's lies!

He's never seen you!
He's never talked to you!
How can his white lies be true?

But I have to understand
This prayer that pays tribute too
It's not here to be true, but help us go through
The deep pain that we bear, the way we all suffer
Our dreams of paradise get the pain out of our minds.

Before you go and walk out on me
Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.

Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.

Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love

I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love

Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair

But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth

Test, check. Well, he's been released today, and I'm going back where I started.
Looking over old notes, listening to tapes, wondering how bad I potentially messed up
this time. The wounds seem to be healing, and he seems to be getting along. But as I
appendage it, and I know he seems fine, But seems can be a very dangerous word,
especially in this business, it can be fatal.

Initial Diagnosis: Catatonic. and I know he's back there somewhere, but there's just
no response whatsoever, to any kind of set illness. We'll start him with medication
tomorrow, for sure.

This mans tragedy has made him a prisoner in his own body. And it's not just tragedy,
it's dementia, despair, its this hole i can see in each of his eyes. Where all the
events that happen in this cruel world just kind of fall through. It's loneliness in
it's most crippling form. The kind that no amount of love, or human contact, could ever
mend.

The patient was plagued by violent nightmares. Terrible, deeply troubling dreams.
Which one night overflowed in to reality, and he murdered his wife, in his sleep.
These people were in love, deeply in love. And it's that love that I can now see
behind his eyes. And it's my job to try and fill those holes with something else.
But what? Hope. I can try to fill those holes with drugs, soothing words, but
that's all. I hope those wounds will heal in time, but right now, things aren't
looking good.

We pass just close enough to touch
No questions, no answers
We know by now to say enough
With only simple words
With only subtle turns
The things we feel alone for one another

There is a secret that we keep
I won't sleep if you won't sleep
Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given
We are compelled to do what we must do
We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden

So I won't sleep if you won't sleep tonight

Our act of defiance
We keep this secret in our blood
No paper or letters
We pass just close enough to touch
We love in secret names
We hide within our veins
The things that keep us bound to one another 

There is a secret that we keep
I won't sleep if you won't sleep
Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given
We are compelled to do what we must do
We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden

Is frozen deep inside my bones
And this broken fate has claimed me
And my memories for its own
Your name is pounding through my veins
Can't you hear how it is sung?
And I can taste you in my mouth
Before the words escape my lungs
And I'll whisper only once...

Living in the Promiseland
Our dreams are made of steels
The prayer of every one 
To know how freedom feels
There is a winding road 
Across shifting sand
And room for everyone
Living in the Promiseland

Nameless woman, faceless child
Like a bad dream
Till there was no room at all
No place to place to run
And no place to fall

Give us your daily bread
We have no shoes to wear
No place to call our home
Only this cross to bear
We are the multitudes
Lend us a helping hand
Is there no love anymore

Can they, Hop?
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
-I spit it through the wire, man -
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
- There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man, I'd gladly risk it all right now - 
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
- It's a life-or-death situation, man - 
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
- Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man -
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
- It's your boy, Kanye to the… Chi-Town, what's goin' on? -

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to work
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
- I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man -
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
- They got my mouth wired shut for like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks -
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
- Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw, I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it -
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
- But I'm still here for y'all right now, man -
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
- This what I got to say right here, dawg, yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh -

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
- Y'know what I'm sayin'? When the doctor told me I had, um -
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
- That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said -
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
- ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"" -
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
- ""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""

I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-
And I was crying on the staircase-
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, Oh.

Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -
but you were everything to me-
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes-

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Oh, Oh.

I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.

We had all day Sunday to rest and relax, before I caught another flight. 
So I decided to walk down town an' get myself a little fresh air. 
Before long, I found myself in front of a big church on the corner of the square. 
Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound. 
So I just walked up the steps an' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down. 
But before I could, a young man walked over to me an said: ""Excuse me, Sir, 
""But I can't let you in with that big black hat, those jeans, that beard an' long hair. 

So I just left, went back outside, sat down on that kerbing, an I thought to myself: 
That's the house of the Lord. That guy's got the hell of a nerve. 
Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please. 
So right there, in front of that Church, I just knelt down on my knees. 

I said: ""Lord, I know I don't look like much, but I didn't think you'd mind. 
""I just wanted to be with your people, Lord: it's been a long time. 
""A while ago, a saw a wino over there in the alley, all bent over in tears, 
""An' I thought how one stained glass window, from this Church, would feed his family for years."" 

""Then there's those fine cars parked outside: too many for me to count. 
""Made me think how people walked for days to hear your sermon on the mount. 
""Then there's those fine ladies in the choir, Lord, singin' like they really love it. 
""Hell, last night, they were dancin' on the front row of my show: drinkin' beer, screamin: 'Sing Shove It.' 

""You know, even John the Baptist wouldn't be welcome in this place, 
""With his coat made of Camel hair an' sandals on his feet an' a long beard on his face. 
""You know, Lord, when you come back to get your children, an' take 'em beyond the clouds, 
""To live forever in Heaven with you: well, I'd sure hate to be in this crowd. 

""You know, Lord, I'm not perfect; some even call me no count. 
""But I'll tell you: I believe a man is judged by what's in his heart, not what's in his bank account. 
""So if this is what religion is: a big car, a suit an' a tie, 
""Then I might as well forget it Lord, 'cause I can't qualify. 

""Oh, by the way, Lord, right before they kicked me out, didn't I see a picture of you?

Pop,"Through the mud and quicksand
Through the undergrowth and vines
We hacked our way along
We had to crawl, we had to climb
Just what was it that pulled us?
It was not riches, nor was it glory
It was affection, and when we found it 
It was sublime

We searched both high and low for what we found in each others' arms, dear
We quested far and wide, while never knowing that it was so near
Now we are explorers of the heart

Trekking over sand dunes
We braved the heat of desert suns
Knowing that we'd rest, at last 
only when we were done

What thing was it that drew us 
Out of our homes and onwards and upwards
It was affection, and when we found it,
It was sublime

We searched both high and low for what we found in each others' arms, dear
We quested far and wide, while never knowing that it was so near
Now there is one place left for us to conquer, one more frontier
Now we are explorers of the heart

In the ocean deep
On the mountain high
In the valley low
Across the river wide
Is where we found it

Climbing over glaciers
Up from the fjords and over ice
Trudging through the snow banks
Relentlessness our only vice

Just what was it that pulled us 
Out of our homes and onwards and upwards
It was affection, and when we found it,
It was sublime

We searched both high and low for what we found in each others' arms, dear
We quested far and wide, while never knowing that it was so near
Now there is one place left for us to conquer, one more frontier
There is no turning back, forget your doubts and ignore your fears

Bring us your trinkets, your baubles of gold

Let us bow down to his great golden calf
Darken our spirits, as we dance and we laugh

The golden calf takes shape - the idol of black hearts
The whole deed, from the sum of its parts
From the healer of sorrow came a great molten blast
With holy tongue of fire, the commandments were cast

Down from the mountain with two tablets of stone
In countenanc white, Moses walked down alone
Instructed by God to bring the people His word
Intoxicated by evil, their judgment obscured
Why should we listen to his set of his rules ?
Deeper in sin sinks the assembly of fools

Visiting evil in the land of the dust
Though shalt not have other gods before Me

her taco is the destination

It soon became apparent
it wasn't for the dough
a genuine fiesta -
at the donkey show
the crowd would shout ""ole!""
as she nibbled on his sack
they never had a patron
demand their money back

A real freak show in the pit
the donkey's fucking my moms tits
acting like a true ranchero
dancing around a big sombrero

The donkey's name was Lucky
oh, boy, he loved to fuck
he'd get so damn excited
he'd kick and make you duck
if you want to be star
it's easy to be famous
just pull down your pants
let lucky fuck your anus

I'm so ashamed it makes me sick
my mothers box was his salt lick
acting like a true ranchero
dancing around a big sombrero

Lucky, the luckiest donkey
Lucky, the luckiest donkey
Lucky, the luckiest donkey

Hau endlich ab, aus deiner kranken Welt,
dir geht es richtig mies und du brauchst Geld.
Du erinnerst dich an früher, als alles besser war,
doch über deine Zukunft bist du dir nicht klar.

Wach auf, du musst entscheiden!
Wach auf, was du machst, ist Zeitverschwndung!

Ich finde es nicht gut, dass du dich nicht wehrst,
dass du deiner Zukunft keinen Zutritt gewährst.
Ein Schritt zurück ist für dich nicht mehr drin,

Jazz,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

Electronic,"Dear friend, as you know
Your flowers are all withering
Your mother's gone missing
Your leaves have drifted away
But the clouds are clearing up
And I've come reveling
Burning incandescently
Like a bastard on the burning sea

But you're just like your father
Buried deep under the water
You're resting on your laurels
And stepping on my toes

Whose side are you on?
What side is this anyways?
Put down your sword and crown
Come lay with me on the ground

You come beating like moth's wings
Spastic and violently
Whipping me into a storm
Shaking me down to the core

But you've run away from me
And you've left me shimmering
Like diamond wedding rings
Spinning dizzily down on the ground

But you're just like your father
Buried deep under the water
You're resting on your laurels
And stepping on my toes

Whose side are you on?
What side is this anyways?
Put down your sword and crown
Come lay with me on the ground",4.571428571428571,5.21875

Nothing like earlier today,

You just got carried away.

This is a fucked up holiday. 
I'm feeling confused.
I'm feeling, not mislead...
But like i'm just a fool.

And if you say it now,
there are already roses on our grave.

Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day
You'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold.

And it's taking you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it had everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy

You're tryin' now
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy

Way down the street there's a lad in his place
He opens the door he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen
And you talk about anything

He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down there's a quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin

But the moment i caught site of her
The light of her
The bright of her

The most beautiful thing in my life

Where she walks, the earth is greener
And the clouds all run away
And she brings a little sunshine
Into everybody's day

You know everytime she's close to me
She glows to me
Arose to me
A shining star, she is by far
The most beautiful thing in my life.

And when she gives me a smile or a touch
Who'd ever think little things mean so much.

Yesterday belongs to someone else
Today belongs to me
I guess that it's my turn at last to know
How sweet that love can be
It's thrilling love
A chilling love
An ever-warm phorphilling love
And in time, she will be mine.

Rap,"Slowly and steadily MC's are fallin off like leprosy
Instead build immunity and spread insight through community
These fundamentals, form the krux of longevity
When melodies are looped and vocals harmonize in unity
Now its 99 and aint a damn thing changed
Some seek fame as wealth manipulates the brain
Let me, paint this picture, your minds the canvas
Many claim their real and later flake like dandruff
Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words
The other 9 stick to my nikes and get rubbed out on the curb
Lets be real, we're paper chasin' for financial backing
But theres a thin line defined by need and greed many are passing
Known as crossing over for exposure some embark
Or cars,jewels and shit that wont exist when we depart
Crews, don't snooze, or eyes become bruised

This goes out to those that slept knew the deal or were confused..
Check the blueprint..

[Chorus]
So MC's, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm
DJ's pay bills develop skills
And respect the architecht as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills..
[scratch]
So respect the architect as we begin to build

Clutchin my pen tight strugglin to portray the right depiction
I'm punchin the wall of writers block, loathing for recognition
Nowadays your not heard, unless your posing an image
With watered down lyrics that appeal to most who listen
Instead i'll water the roots so branches will replenish
Expanding elements that pioneers started building
Hiphop houses, so many free loading MC's
I feel theres only a few tenants who've been paying their fees
360 degrees what goes around comes back
I'm smoking mics as I inhale lies and exhale facts
Unfold the blueprints, the plans for improvement
Bridging gaps between the mind, ball point pen and the clueless
Innovation is useless once you forget the essence
So respect the architect. pick up your pens and start sketchin
Pick up your pens and start sketching..

[Chorus]
So MC's, take it back to lyricism
Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm
DJ's pay bills develop skills
And respect the architecht as we begin to build
And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive
And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive
And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills
[scratch]
So respect the architect as we begin to build

As I open my slanty eyes to this place called earth
I contemplate how music has lost artistic worth
And I'm shrivled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing
With bags under my eyes on account of too much sleeping
Because of these lies in rap that I can't feel
Leaving me dazed with the phrase ""i keep it real""
How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears
I'd rather be fed in the mouth, to shit it out from the rear
Claiming their underground but underwater their wrinkling
And me like water buoys to that level I'm never sinking
Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lispin'
Then when finished biting them, find your front teeth missing
I see em sippin fine wines in spas, to match their image
Gimmicks.. I flap my jaws and their squads diminished
I don't mess with glocks but metaphorically in speech
I'd like to pump em' with more shots than diabetics receive
Then in a better place may they peacefully rest
In hopes that next time the blueprints they'll manifest
Check the blueprint...

""Is this the day?""

I alone have heard this glad refrain

When people get married they always have a dance
The music is grand with a samba band
The people are carried away with such romance

Will bring a pretty senorita to her feet

And when they play The Wedding Samba

She'll say ""I do"" and seal it with a samba beat

Out of the blue, suddenly you were there

Glancing my way in the grey of the dawn

And always your smile holds that strange invitation

Sometimes the way I feel inside is gonna show
You know we're all the same
I know you're tired you try to talk
But you think I don't hear you anymore
Here it comes again

But sometimes you just take it too far

You can shoot me down and call me names
Scream until the neighbours all complain
I know you'll tell your friends it's all my fault
And I will take the blame
But give me back forever again

Sometimes you try sometimes you don't
Sometimes the way you feel inside is gonna show
But some things never change
So walk away and count to ten
Say how you feel don't say that again
We'll find another way

'Cause you don't have to take it so far

You can shoot me down and call me names
Scream until the neighbours all complain
And I know you'll tell your friends it's all my fault
And I will take the blame
But give me back forever again

If feels like I'm breathing under water
It feels like I'm watching my whole world crash
And you can say you don't know if you love me
But never that you never have

You can shoot me down and call me names
Scream until the neighbors all complain

I know you'll tell your friends it's all my fault
And I will take the blame
Just give me back forever again.

Rap,"[Rakaa Iriscience]
no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

We startin' to pet And that's when I get Her talcum all over my vest. After I kinda straighten my tie, She has to borrow my comb. One kiss, then I continue again Walkin' my baby back home.She 'fraid of the dark, so I have to park Outside of her door till it's light She says if I try To kiss her, she'll cry I dry her tears all through the night.

You kiss me goodbye just like always

Country,"You know, I worked the Big Packet show in Fort Worth, Saturday night, 
We had all day Sunday to rest and relax, before I caught another flight. 
So I decided to walk down town an' get myself a little fresh air. 
Before long, I found myself in front of a big church on the corner of the square. 
Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound. 
So I just walked up the steps an' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down. 
But before I could, a young man walked over to me an said: ""Excuse me, Sir, 
""But I can't let you in with that big black hat, those jeans, that beard an' long hair. 

So I just left, went back outside, sat down on that kerbing, an I thought to myself: 
That's the house of the Lord. That guy's got the hell of a nerve. 
Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please. 
So right there, in front of that Church, I just knelt down on my knees. 

I said: ""Lord, I know I don't look like much, but I didn't think you'd mind. 
""I just wanted to be with your people, Lord: it's been a long time. 
""A while ago, a saw a wino over there in the alley, all bent over in tears, 
""An' I thought how one stained glass window, from this Church, would feed his family for years."" 

""Then there's those fine cars parked outside: too many for me to count. 
""Made me think how people walked for days to hear your sermon on the mount. 
""Then there's those fine ladies in the choir, Lord, singin' like they really love it. 
""Hell, last night, they were dancin' on the front row of my show: drinkin' beer, screamin: 'Sing Shove It.' 

""You know, even John the Baptist wouldn't be welcome in this place, 
""With his coat made of Camel hair an' sandals on his feet an' a long beard on his face. 
""You know, Lord, when you come back to get your children, an' take 'em beyond the clouds, 
""To live forever in Heaven with you: well, I'd sure hate to be in this crowd. 

""You know, Lord, I'm not perfect; some even call me no count. 
""But I'll tell you: I believe a man is judged by what's in his heart, not what's in his bank account. 
""So if this is what religion is: a big car, a suit an' a tie, 
""Then I might as well forget it Lord, 'cause I can't qualify. 

""Oh, by the way, Lord, right before they kicked me out, didn't I see a picture of you? 
""With sandals an' a beard. Believe you had long hair too.""

I coming to see her real soon I hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last

The postman was passing and picked up the note
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke
Straight up into heaven this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know",5.0,9.2

Before you go and walk out on me
Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.

Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break

Although you couldn't have jacked the disrespect
The technique, sweat meet, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Why my purpose on the surface of this earth is
Plan it, standards, trust and the purpose
Campaign in vein for the same lame fame, people obtain, you ought to be detained
By the hip hop sheriff, locked up
no possibility of getting out cause the shit you make is killing me and my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear
we disappear, then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope its peaceful and cloudy cause if its not we gotta fight like, fight like

He'd say you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything
You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything

Er sagt vor Gott sind alle gleich,

Er sagt, ob Kaiser oder Führer -
alles Kriegsverlierer,

dann wird mir manches clearer

Kaiser, Fürsten, Könige - all beliebte Monarchen
erfreut erneut wohin heut der Zug der Zeit sie fährt
Gebt dem Lande tollkühnste Parade-Patriachen,
gebt dem Volk die Heiligen, die es so begehrt

Monarchy now, alive

Dürfte im schlimmsten Fall ich wählen,
zwischen monströsen oder dekandenten Seelen,
zwischen Reichstandarte und Schönbrunner Flieder,
da wär' der Kronprinz mir noch lieber

Der hat zwar nie sein Reich besessen,
dafür a Unzahl von Mätressen
Das blieb auch so in jedem Fall
In dem Punkt - da wär' er liberal

Country,"See the ruin on the hill, where the smoke is hanging still,
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.",5.2,10.038461538461538

A dark light's entering the church
By pale glass windows
and I feel so cold

I can't stop looking at the wooden box placed
In the very centre of the nave
I'm trying to imagine you...
...sleeping

We're in the home
Of life and death
Where each being takes end
And time flows with the sand!

We cry as one
Your friends, your family
Death has stained this day
And now he's gone away

I think you would be smiling
Listening to this priest today
Before his church
I can still remember
Your songs about Christendom and stovery

I can't realise!
Death before my eyes!
Listening to this sermon's lies!

He's never seen you!
He's never talked to you!
How can his white lies be true?

But I have to understand
This prayer that pays tribute too
It's not here to be true, but help us go through
The deep pain that we bear, the way we all suffer
Our dreams of paradise get the pain out of our minds.

Cause then we'll know that we can show what we have from the day

Where do we go from here (I need to know, I need to know)
What do I do with these feelings
Longinh to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

I need to know where do we gooooo oh
I know I should walk away something keeps telling me one mo day
Maybe if I'm patience then one day it would change yeaaaah

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

Let's let it go.

I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December
I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender

Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta

Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my
It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front seat
So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep
Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy

I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat

But I'd tried to stay wide awake
Cause you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?
Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya

Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars

Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water
Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand

around 30K, if they don't get hit with an AK
And found out that the security's runnin another way
Like with me, it's Murder, probably
If I could drop in to manslaughter get a bail and flee
Cause my downess says bitch up, let her handle the pick up
Snow cone the country leave no market untouched
Call me drugs if this is how they pushin us rafters

Instead build immunity and spread insight through community
These fundamentals, form the krux of longevity
When melodies are looped and vocals harmonize in unity

Let me, paint this picture, your minds the canvas
Many claim their real and later flake like dandruff
Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words
The other 9 stick to my nikes and get rubbed out on the curb

I contemplate how music has lost artistic worth
And I'm shrivled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing
With bags under my eyes on account of too much sleeping
Because of these lies in rap that I can't feel
Leaving me dazed with the phrase ""i keep it real""
How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears
I'd rather be fed in the mouth, to shit it out from the rear
Claiming their underground but underwater their wrinkling
And me like water buoys to that level I'm never sinking
Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lispin'
Then when finished biting them, find your front teeth missing
I see em sippin fine wines in spas, to match their image
Gimmicks.. I flap my jaws and their squads diminished
I don't mess with glocks but metaphorically in speech
I'd like to pump em' with more shots than diabetics receive
Then in a better place may they peacefully rest
In hopes that next time the blueprints they'll manifest
Check the blueprint...

The moon is shining, and that's a good sign

Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine

Remember, darling, we won't see it shine

A hundred years from today

A hundred years from today



Don't save your kisses, just pass them around

You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound

Who's going to know that you passed them around

A hundred years from today!

Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen

You're nearer heaven on Mother Earth's green

If you had millions what would they all mean

A hundred years from today

So laugh and sing, make love the thing

Be happy while you may

There's always one, beneath the sun

Who's bound to make you feel that way

The moon is shining, and that's a good sign

Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine

Before you go and walk out on me
Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love

Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair

But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love",8.75,5.285714285714286

You're probably half way to Albuquerque
You'll hang a north up to Santa Fe

To watch you walk away

Of a melancholy moon
My pillow smells like your perfume
Missing you in my blue bedroom

I guess you did what you had to do
If you find that love is what you're needing
It's waiting here for you

A beautiful theme of every dream I ever knew

""Is this the day?""

I alone have heard this lovely strain
I alone have heard this glad refrain
Must it be forever inside of me?

Into the darkness goes this message sweet Marie

They must end what they have started
All that's left is the broken hearted, I must depart my sweet Marie

Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp

How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed

You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)

I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass

Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past

And ol' midnight knows it, too.

Does it mean that our love is ending.

Darlin' I need you, lately I find

You're out of my heart,

Our dreams are made of steels
The prayer of every one 
To know how freedom feels
There is a winding road 
Across shifting sand
And room for everyone

So they came with such a sad eye
Nameless woman, faceless child
Like a bad dream
Till there was no room at all
No place to place to run
And no place to fall

Give us your daily bread

No place to call our home
Only this cross to bear
We are the multitudes
Lend us a helping hand

Ooh, ooh, closer, closer.
Long ago, seems so far away,
I fell in love with you, and that feeling remained.
Looking back I recall how you never could see,
All the feelings I kept deep inside that I didn't set free.

But still I, I wanna be close to you, I wanna be close to you.
Still I, I wanna get close to you, I wanna get close to you.

All of my close friends said I lived in a dream,
But it didn't matter at all, cuz they just couldn't see.
That your guitar was just playing for me.
Never gonna listen to them cuz I still want to be,

And still I, I wanna be close to you, I wanna be close to you.
Still I, I wanna get close to you, I wanna get close to you.
Still I, I wanna be close to you, I wanna be close to you.
Still I, I wanna get close to you, I wanna get close to you.

Your guitar is just playing for me
Now I'm gonna let my feelings show, cuz I still wanna be...

Rap,"I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's
Cause they don't make no songs like these

show her that you're not that shy.
Let her see that fancy footwork,
show her you're that type of guy.

In the very centre of the nave

...sleeping

We're in the home
Of life and death
Where each being takes end
And time flows with the sand!

We cry as one
Your friends, your family
Death has stained this day
And now he's gone away

I think you would be smiling
Listening to this priest today
Before his church
I can still remember
Your songs about Christendom and stovery

I can't realise!
Death before my eyes!
Listening to this sermon's lies!

He's never seen you!
He's never talked to you!
How can his white lies be true?

But I have to understand
This prayer that pays tribute too
It's not here to be true, but help us go through
The deep pain that we bear, the way we all suffer
Our dreams of paradise get the pain out of our minds.

Metal,"If we cannot see then we can't show
We all have ways of finding out the things we don't know
The path or truth some find they hear it in a sound
Well I can breathe it in and see the darkness all around
I see things every day in every way
Unleashed unchained and unrestrained so I can say
the death and hate I see I'll bring it to the ground
I can breathe it in and bring entire systems down

Break through baby I've never felt this good
Because I know I've seen what the others should have to see
Who left the light in these blinded eyes?
Street wise soldier I always thought I would bring back
the fight our mothers and fathers could
They rocked the system and changed their lives

I turned my face away
it's the only way to see what I am
so I don't have to breathe

And now I see the sights I had on the are now on me
Tell me when did I go wrong?
Have I been this heartless and selfish and fucked up all along?
How did lose proof?
Did I forget to reach the youth and expose the truth?
But now instead of all the things I thought I shed
The only thing I can really see is that I am already dead

Broken bones Matilda left a note and a rose
Sayin', ""Baby honey child, I've loved you so long
But you deserve much better than me.""
So I'm just burnin' all around all the miles in the road
And I'm never goin' back and I'm never goin' home
I've been gone too long, I've been less right than wrong
I lost so much blood in the fallin' out

And I lit a fire that wouldn't go out
Until it consumed the walls and roof of this house
Until all I remember was burnin' away
And all I remember, you burned it away

See, for ten long years I've been hustlin' around
Tryin' to wash the sins and the sweat from my brow
Just tryin' to find a better life for me and my own
Just some rest for these tired workin' fingers

But nobody never gonna tell you the way
You gotta figure it out boys and suffer the rain
And the fools in the night and the heat of the day
When all you ever really wanted was for someone to understand

Arise, avatars of chaos,
Incinerate yourselves,
In the blaze of Babylon,
Hierophants of the Hurricane,
We invoke the Eidolon.

Unleash the storm...

We renounce the sin,
Of mortal fallacy,
Bestow upon us,

Peel the benighted shells,
From our radiant cores,
We obey the laws,
Of finitude no more.

Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend...
Open the Silver Gate...
Melt yourself beyond all control.

Give birth to the vision,
Let enter the voice,
And dare not falter,
Lest the demons eat you.
Confide in your Nuit,
Never your senses.

Nine apparitions,
The nails of Yod,
Drip from the moon
As unhallowed blood,
Anubis' terror to feed you,
As the night condenses.

Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend...
Open the Silver Gate...
Melt yourself beyond all control.

Tarnished minion abide,
Convocating execrations,
To drown and smother, to divide.

Discard the body,
And savour this, your threnody,
Divine by lust alone,
And second skin,
As the eyes turn to stone,
Let the heave begin!

Shemhazai!
Rejoin your kin in faith and fate!

Heed not the warnings,

There is no peace at the gate,
There is no peace at the gate...

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.",5.2,10.038461538461538

I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain

Metal,"You're on the breeze
You rest in grey
Eternally sleep
Erase the day
I couldn't see her
Through all the rain
And her sigh
Holding our breath to the end

We end up far away
Out on the breeze
Take me past the horizon
We're running out of time

Anywhere is nowhere
Everywhere is fear
And you just
All the walls of my gloomy house?
It's like awaiting
The end of the world
Here in this days?
The end of the world

There is no answer
To all that is crying
When all those die
To carry on forever

Let me talk to 'em for a minute (Murder Inc. bosses in the building)
Yeah, haha

Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about the benjamins and nobody ain't doin it like us
C'mon what y'all want?

Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about sex, money, and murder
Bitches that burn ya, niggas with burners
Cocked and let go!

[Verse 1]
Fuck all y'all motherfuckin bitch ass niggas
I'm talkin to whoever wanna be ridin my dick
And you know your gon' get it as hot as I spit it
It's the Rule and nobody wanna be bothered with
If I hit 'em in every direction with four fifths
Will expend like 45's with compact discs (c'mon)
It's a disappointment to see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed
When I'm one of rap's anointed
Who else used to order it all on the dick
Like when I come through with spinners on the six
And got bitches bouncin like Ronnie in Tricks
But some whores in this game really don't make sense
Bomb roof and via Cal's and clonin Ems
But when bullets go through your film, we break your limbs
A horror show, yeah picture this
Cause I guess you can't see it, it's Murder again

[Verse 2]
Rule I fuck with bitches in Manolos and thick Louie Vuitton logos
Cause I don't love these hoes
I'm above and beyond everything that your seein
And I'm the only real nigga left rappin this freakin
If I could be one of the seasons, you'd call me summer
The way I bang the heater out the back of the Hummer
The bull just move like runners from city block to city block
Layin down the foundation for what's really hot
Y'all niggas really not on my level (c'mon)
I'm like slugs when they pierce the metal, you see sparks (what)
My voice is a brush, they hear it it's like art
And nobody can really tell the twins apart
I call one Nina, other one Santa Maria
I might roll up on your set, dump and lean ya
My bitch is cocked to bang men in Virginia
Don't make me run up on ya, put a few in ya

Yeah, yeah, yo, Murder's outlaw, that guess I get a city's a broads
So I push the Porsche high and truck to court
Holla at the judge if the judge made a bad decision
I feel like the nigga that triggerin guns with mittens
It's hard to get done, I'm hearin that security runs
around 30K, if they don't get hit with an AK
And found out that the security's runnin another way
Like with me, it's Murder, probably
If I could drop in to manslaughter get a bail and flee
Cause my downess says bitch up, let her handle the pick up
Snow cone the country leave no market untouched
Call me drugs if this is how they pushin us rafters
But I don't do it cause I need it, I do it cause I want more
Definition is greed, I do it cause I want yours
And y'all niggas is teasin, y'all don't really want war
But if you really do, your gonna need a lot more

Dirty blood trickles gushes then torrents flow down to the gutter where nobody knows

It festers and decomposes

Without nourishment

Its taking hold the pain the narcotic
Cutting through the spleen
Severing devouring everything
The pain of it ploughs me over

Frothing heaving sucking the air from my lungs
A shelter for maggots

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Rock,"I would race you anytime
Steal the daylight from your eyes
Somehow you never knew
Things change and so do you
Still I would race you anytime
Fool around, trick your eye
Some dreams still hunt you down
You thought we just fooled around

There were pictures from the past
There were memories that did not last
Don't you do that again
Don't call if you need a friend",6.0,5.75
Country,"Goodbye Joe, me gotta' go, me oh my oh
Me gotta' go pole the pirogue down the buyou

Rap,"Hard times spreading just like the flu
Watch out homeboy, don't let it catch you
P-p-prices go up, don't let your pocket go down
When you got short money you're stuck on the ground
Turn around, get ready, keep your eye on the prize
And be on point for the future shock

Hard times [repeat 2x]

Hard times are coming to your town
So stay alert, don't let them get you down
They tell you times are tough, you hear that times are hard
But when you work for that ace you know you pulled the right card
Hard times got our pockets all in chains
I'll tell you what, homeboy, it don't have my brain
All day I have to work at my peak
Beacuse I need that dollar every day of the weak

Hard times

Hard times can take you on a natural trip
So keep your balance, and don't you slip
Hard times is nothing new on me
I'm gonna use my strong mentality
Like the cream of the crop, like the crop of the cream
B-b-beating hard times, that is my theme
Hard times in life, hard times in death
I'm gonna keep on fighting to my very last breath

Rock,"Close comes the winter
Summer is no longer
And things, they seem much bleaker
We'll see a Catherine Deneuve double feature
And our lives will fade as in darkness we will bathe

Last forever so rest your eyes

This double feature means everything",5.0,6.6
Jazz,"Yesterday I saw the sun shinin',
And the leaves were fallin' down softly,
My cold hands needed a warm, warm touch,
And I was thinkin' about you.
Here I am lookin' for signs of leaving,
You hold my hand, but do you really need me?
I guess it's time for me to let you go,
And I've been thinkin' about you,
I've been thinkin' about you.

When you sail across the ocean waters,
And you reach the other side safely,
Could you smile a little smile for me?

I'll be thinkin' about you,
I'll be thinkin' about you,
I'll be thinkin' about you.",8.0,6.8125
Electronic,"Monochromatic reasoning
A divide and conquer legacy
Dissect and over-simplify
All hail the death of compromise

CHORUS
The world isn't rendered in black and white
Other shades lie between
Don't view the world with binary eyes
We are human, not machine

Eliminate the critical
When it all becomes too difficult
Ignore the layers of subtlety
Force feed them full of your beliefs

(CHORUS)

Some day when we all awake
From the dreams we dreamt for country's sake
The logic you let come undone
Is the noose that you'll be hanging from

Metal,"If we cannot see then we can't show
We all have ways of finding out the things we don't know
The path or truth some find they hear it in a sound
Well I can breathe it in and see the darkness all around
I see things every day in every way
Unleashed unchained and unrestrained so I can say
the death and hate I see I'll bring it to the ground
I can breathe it in and bring entire systems down

Break through baby I've never felt this good
Because I know I've seen what the others should have to see
Who left the light in these blinded eyes?
Street wise soldier I always thought I would bring back
the fight our mothers and fathers could
They rocked the system and changed their lives

I turned my face away
it's the only way to see what I am
so I don't have to breathe

And now I see the sights I had on the are now on me
Tell me when did I go wrong?
Have I been this heartless and selfish and fucked up all along?
How did lose proof?
Did I forget to reach the youth and expose the truth?
But now instead of all the things I thought I shed
The only thing I can really see is that I am already dead

RnB,"Good evening.
Do not attempt to adjust your radio, there is nothing wrong.
We have taken control as to bring you this special show.
We will return it to you as soon as you are grooving.

Welcome to station WEFUNK, better known as We-Funk,
Or deeper still, the Mothership Connection.
Home of the extraterrestrial brothers,
Dealers of funky music.
P.Funk, uncut funk, The Bomb.

Coming to you directly from the Mothership
Top of the Chocolate Milky Way, 500,000 kilowatts of P.Funk-power.
So kick back, dig, while we do it to you in your eardrums.
And me? I'm known as Lollipop Man, alias the Long-Haired Sucker.
My motto is:

Make my funk the P.Funk

WEFUNK, y'all.
Now this is what I want you all to do:
If you got faults, defects or shortcomings,
You know, like arthritis, rheumatism or migraines,
Whatever part of your body it is,
I want you to lay it on your radio, let the vibes flow through.
Funk not only moves, it can re-move, dig?
The desired effect is what you get
When you improve your Interplanetary Funksmanship.
Sir Lollipop Man! Chocolate coated, freaky and and habit forming.
Doin' it to you in 3-D,
So groovy that I dig me.
Once upon a time called Now!
Somebody say, ""Is there funk after death?""

So you can feel cool.
Gangster lean.
Y'all should dig my sun-rooftop.
Well, allright. Hey I was diggin' on y'alls funk for awhile.
Sounds like it got a three on it though, to me.
Then I was down south and I heard some funk with some main ingredients
Like Doobie Brothers, Blue Magic, David Bowie.
It was cool,
But can you imagine Doobiein' your funk? Ho!
WEFUNK, we funk.
Make my funk the P.Funk (ho!)
I want my funk uncut (oh, make mine)

Rap,"Message Post: 6/10/90-never Subject: Louis Logic. You said it folks, this guy is clever
He got extra dope rhymes and punchlines forever. His stuff would catch in no time if his production guy was better
And there's nothing I like better than new battle lyrics. My favorite jam's Secret Agent, man. You have to hear it!
I heard it got a fat review in a mag or two, and now the majors want him. It would suck if that was true
It ain't a cat half as fat as Lou that's as true to stayin' indie, or dudes with punchlines on major labels sayin' any
He even answers all his e-mails if he's got a chance at all, and told me Ikon's real name was Vinnie

Maybe when he's gettin' chased by a bunch of sweaty faced, record snakes with chainsaws and machete blades

In pursuit like Leatherface and Jason, He'll be the first kid who don't forget his place and sustains the basement

Anyway, hit me on my e-mail if you disagree, or wanna spit a free. Later DMX63.",2.25,20.0

Can they, Hop?
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
-I spit it through the wire, man -
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
- There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man, I'd gladly risk it all right now - 
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
- It's a life-or-death situation, man - 
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way

Right down to the wire, even through the fire
- It's your boy, Kanye to the… Chi-Town, what's goin' on? -

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to work
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
- I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man -
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
- They got my mouth wired shut for like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks -
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
- Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw, I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it -
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
- But I'm still here for y'all right now, man -
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
- This what I got to say right here, dawg, yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh -

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
- Y'know what I'm sayin'? When the doctor told me I had, um -
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
- That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said -
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
- ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"" -
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
- ""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""

How to be the smooth operator, dominator in the state of Georgia
Hip hops there to destroy ya
Leave a mother fucker open like a foyer
He from the dirt now here come the paranoia
Although you couldn't have jacked the disrespect
The technique, sweat meet, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Why my purpose on the surface of this earth is
Plan it, standards, trust and the purpose
Campaign in vein for the same lame fame, people obtain, you ought to be detained
By the hip hop sheriff, locked up
no possibility of getting out cause the shit you make is killing me and my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear
we disappear, then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope its peaceful and cloudy cause if its not we gotta fight like, fight like

A sad and lonely boy,
Did not know how to get better,

Then heaven up above,
Sent me a super love,
And now I'm happy forever.

No one wants to believe,
I've got a perfect love,
They say I'm just talking crazy,

But I can prove it's true,
If you'l allow me to,
Tell you 'bout my Super Lady

She's all that I could explore,
She's more than a dream,
She's my everthing

Be feeling half this good,
The world for me is new place,

I'll drink to happiness,
Because our love's the best,
The wine for me has a new taste,

I'll let my lady know,
I'll never let her go,
Forever I'm gonna hold on,

She said she feel's the same,
Don't wanna play no game,
Just wants our love to live on and on,

Wish I could fly to the sky,
And write out her name,

Climb to the top of the world,
And loudly exclaim,

Rap,"I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's

Your new found meat
A misbehaving lie

Why would you say sorry
Oh, why would you say
Why would you say

You said there
Was a nagging lack of smiles
Went dancing on your back
Tenderness a plenty book
That wasn't what you craved
His whole thin heart desire
Start to make demands
And he adored you
Would be a fool
To make your plans with her

Why would you say sorry
Oh, why would you
Why would you say sorry
Oh, why would you say sorry
Oh, why would you

When it's just one
Of many bullets
You will bite
While waiting
For a ray of light

And the many times he lied

So your heart belongs to you now
And you know that it's right

Feel so much better, leaving yesterday behind
But always remember, hold on to life

So for all of your regrets
That your poor heart won't let you forget

So much stronger when the sun rises
So don't find your fear alarming

Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I lived, a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, C-cypher power stalk plus the fiend talk
Three G's accost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisonin the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blastin
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened, shhhh

Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears

Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches
Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable
Interchangable, caution flameable

Retrieve through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed

Rock,"How here's a little story - I've got to tell
About three bad brothers - you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock, M.C.A., and me - Mike D.
Been had a little horsy named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer
Riding across the land - kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse on my tail cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself - without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is gettin' hot - the beer is getting flat
Lookin' for a girl - I ran into a guy
His name is M.C.A., I said, ""Howdy"" - he said, ""Hi""

He told a little story - that sounded well rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand - and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry - he asked me for a sip
He said, ""Can I get some?""
I said, ""You can't get none!""
Had a chance to run
He pulled out his shotgun
He was quick on the draw - I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said,

""Now my name is M.C.A. - I've got a license to kill
I think you know what time it is - it's time to get ill
Now what do we have here - an outlaw and his beer
I run this land, you understand - I make myself clear.""
We stepped into the wind - he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over but it's ready to begin

""Now I got the gun - you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me"" I said, I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this - I did it like that
I did it with a whiffleball bat
So I'm on the run - the cop's got my gun
And right about now - it's time to have some fun
The King Adrock - that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.""
We rode for six hours the we hit the spot
The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
M.C.A. said, ""Yo, you know this kid?""
I said, ""I didn't."" - but I know he did
The kid said, ""Get ready cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money.""
Pulled out the jammy - aimed it at the sky
He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" - and let two fly
Hands went up and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
""I'm Mike D. and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect""
M.C.A. was with it and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face
The piano player's out - the music stopped
His boy had beef - and he got dropped
Mike D. grabbed the money - M.C.A. snatched the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold",15.25,9.819672131147541

Let me get the Gat
Run up on 'em strapped
Bust off caps on four niggas
Laid low for 'bout a month and killed two more niggas
Now I'm ready to chill but you still want me to kill

Naw, that's my man

Jazz,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Country,"(Feat. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson) 
I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",6.75,8.555555555555555

Dirty blood trickles gushes then torrents flow down to the gutter where nobody knows

Crawling down its black throat

It festers and decomposes
Colourless odourless
Without nourishment

Its taking hold the pain the narcotic
Cutting through the spleen
Severing devouring everything
The pain of it ploughs me over

Frothing heaving sucking the air from my lungs
A shelter for maggots
Intoxicated rancid distorted sleep the worm vomits vats of despair
Twisting shapes from thin air
Damaged cells lying everywhere

Crawling down its black throat

-I spit it through the wire, man -
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
- There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man, I'd gladly risk it all right now - 
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may

For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to work
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all

And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it -
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
- But I'm still here for y'all right now, man -
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
- This what I got to say right here, dawg, yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh -

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all

For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way

Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 
in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..
I don't know you and no, 
I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
No patience is in me and if you offend me 
I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air 
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you

and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin

Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound.

That's the house of the Lord. That guy's got the hell of a nerve. 
Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please.

Glancing my way in the grey of the dawn

And always your smile holds that strange invitation

Then you are gone

How long must I live in a world of illusion

Be where you are so near yet so far, apart

Hoping you'll say with a sweet invitation

Where have you been, darling come in

Down below the cars in the city go rushing by,

Downtown the young ones are going,
Downtown the young ones are growing,

We're the kids in America,
We're the kids in America,
Everybody live for the music around,

The music gets faster,
Look boy don't check on your watch, Not another glance,
I'm not leaving now honey not a chance,
Hot shot give me no problems,
Much later baby you'll be, saying ""nevermind,""
You know life is cruel,
Life is never kind,

Kind hearts don't make a new story,
Kind hearts don't grab any glory,

We're the kids in America,
We're the kids in America,
Everybody live for the music around,

Come closer honey thats better,
Gotta get a brand new experience feeling right,
Oh, don't try to stop baby hold me tight,
Outside a new day is dawning,
Outside suburbia calling, everywhere,
I don't want to go baby,

There's a new way come in on ya,

RnB,"Good evening.
Do not attempt to adjust your radio, there is nothing wrong.
We have taken control as to bring you this special show.
We will return it to you as soon as you are grooving.

Welcome to station WEFUNK, better known as We-Funk,
Or deeper still, the Mothership Connection.
Home of the extraterrestrial brothers,
Dealers of funky music.
P.Funk, uncut funk, The Bomb.

Coming to you directly from the Mothership
Top of the Chocolate Milky Way, 500,000 kilowatts of P.Funk-power.
So kick back, dig, while we do it to you in your eardrums.
And me? I'm known as Lollipop Man, alias the Long-Haired Sucker.
My motto is:

Make my funk the P.Funk
I want my funk uncut (make mine the P)
Make my funk the P.Funk
I wants to get funked up. (wants to get funked up)
I want the bomb,
I want the P.Funk (yeah)
I want my funk uncut. (make mine the P)
Make my funk the P.Funk
I wants to get funked up.

WEFUNK, y'all.
Now this is what I want you all to do:
If you got faults, defects or shortcomings,
You know, like arthritis, rheumatism or migraines,
Whatever part of your body it is,
I want you to lay it on your radio, let the vibes flow through.
Funk not only moves, it can re-move, dig?
The desired effect is what you get
When you improve your Interplanetary Funksmanship.
Sir Lollipop Man! Chocolate coated, freaky and and habit forming.
Doin' it to you in 3-D,
So groovy that I dig me.
Once upon a time called Now!
Somebody say, ""Is there funk after death?""
I say, ""Is Seven Up?""
Yeah, P.Funk!

Make my funk the P.Funk (make mine)
I want my funk uncut (the P)
Make my funk the P.Funk (hah!)
I wants to get funked up. (WEFUNK, y'all)
I want the bomb, (home of the bomb)
I want the P.Funk
I want my funk stepped on (Don't step on my funk)
Make my funk the P.Funk
Before I take it home

Yeah, I dig!
Let me put my sunglasses on.
That's the law around here, you got to wear your sunglasses.
So you can feel cool.
Gangster lean.
Y'all should dig my sun-rooftop.
Well, allright. Hey I was diggin' on y'alls funk for awhile.
Sounds like it got a three on it though, to me.
Then I was down south and I heard some funk with some main ingredients
Like Doobie Brothers, Blue Magic, David Bowie.
It was cool,
But can you imagine Doobiein' your funk? Ho!
WEFUNK, we funk.
Make my funk the P.Funk (ho!)
I want my funk uncut (oh, make mine)

Metal,"Confessor 
Of the tragedies in man 
Lurking in the core of us all 
The last dying call for the everlost 
Brief encounters, bleeding pain 
Lepers coiled neath the trees 

Dying men in bewildered soliloquys 

Perversions bloom round the bend 

Seekers, lost in their quest 

Ghosts of friends frolic 

under the waning moon 

It is the year of death 

Wielding his instruments 

Stealth sovereign reaper 

Touching us with ease 

Infecting the roots in an instant 

Burning crop of disease 

I am just a spectator 

An advocate documenting the loss 

Fluttering with conceit 

This doesn't concern me yet 

Still far from the knell 

Taunting their bereavement 

Mod round the dead 

Point fingers at the details 

Probing vomits for more 

Caight in unbridled suspense 

We have all lost it now 

Catching the flakes of dismay 

Born the travesty of man 

Regular pulse midst pandemonium 

You're plucked to the mass 

Parched with thirst for the wicked 

Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark 

The sun sets forever over Blackwater park",1.1666666666666667,4.714285714285714

And the leaves were fallin' down softly,
My cold hands needed a warm, warm touch,
And I was thinkin' about you.
Here I am lookin' for signs of leaving,
You hold my hand, but do you really need me?
I guess it's time for me to let you go,
And I've been thinkin' about you,
I've been thinkin' about you.

When you sail across the ocean waters,
And you reach the other side safely,
Could you smile a little smile for me?

The reapers following.
A condemned club for both weak and poor.
I tear my new flesh. Ripping and wearing it out.
Trying to rise in a cast only I know exists.
Abstaining my yesterday. Welcome my tomorrow.
Let the present lead. Head my inner bleed.

My acts of foolishness. Victimize the perpetual soil.
I, I, I, I die alone.

Screaming, fighting and tearing my inside.
Screaming fight in me.

This is the first trace of a weak show.
I know that as I take my first step into this freak
show. Lying down on the cold concrete.

Surrounded by my own stench. Panic rising,
Takes me further. This room has never looked this
Beautiful before.",3.4,7.176470588235294

Then tell me one thing more before I go

Cash in the envelope, spend it on kinfolk

Twenty-five to lifers, true and livin snipers

Serial killers tote guns without the serial
High-tech, street intellect, all digital

Took a year hiatus, now you wanna hate us
Thanks to all you haters for all the cream you made us

I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place

And pray for the thunder

Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love

I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love

Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair

But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love",8.75,5.285714285714286

I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain

And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",6.75,8.555555555555555

(As so it goes..)
""At least I think I was here asleep...
Is it possible, conceiveable that I sleepwalked out of my apartment
And went berzerk?""

[Aesop Rock]
In slipped rhythm
Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment
Parked in front the fan
And reminesce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand
'Tesants get the New York home game
With real life shoot-em-up action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art
Free game piece all included
I told this cat the earth was flat
He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
Brick-a-back novelty
Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed Tequilla worm future, be concerned
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the sand
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reaks of subway metal
Feather lecture journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with voices
Benefit to break room
Mummified manequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This a Malcom circus, got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you SUCKA!
I lay the Lord down upon its belly
With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk
Yelling 'Break yo'self!'
I'm the actualized data commission past penny tip jar donation
Been arranged, made by the farfetch from stability 
Took a heart pledge early on
Bled onto the drum doser
Plow in the metronome, home 
Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster
Sensation'll leave siesomgraph stabbin away on stone tablets
To sketch up out your future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
But have canceled developed, courtesy America
Land of the free base
Home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker
It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed
With dilapadated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece
A sweat a bit to make my Wookie ends meet
Pascifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate
Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit apparently
Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me'
Ok, time to buckle the fuck down 
Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You can catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process
Hence, your plight botches

""I don't know what got into me
I didn't even cause all that destruction
I'm sorry...so sorry""

down in Mexico
she had treinta margaritas
treinta years ago
her purse had just been stolen
she rad to make some cash
for fifty thousand pesos
the donkey fucked her ass

I'm so ashamed it makes me sick
my mothers box was his salt lick
human-donkey fornication
her taco is the destination

It soon became apparent
it wasn't for the dough
a genuine fiesta -
at the donkey show
the crowd would shout ""ole!""
as she nibbled on his sack
they never had a patron
demand their money back

A real freak show in the pit
the donkey's fucking my moms tits
acting like a true ranchero
dancing around a big sombrero

The donkey's name was Lucky
oh, boy, he loved to fuck
he'd get so damn excited
he'd kick and make you duck
if you want to be star
it's easy to be famous
just pull down your pants
let lucky fuck your anus

Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Why my purpose on the surface of this earth is
Plan it, standards, trust and the purpose
Campaign in vein for the same lame fame, people obtain, you ought to be detained
By the hip hop sheriff, locked up
no possibility of getting out cause the shit you make is killing me and my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear
we disappear, then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope its peaceful and cloudy cause if its not we gotta fight like, fight like

I never knew such bliss existed
Or maybe it's just so indescribable
Love was liable to get her twisted
She never told me but if she tried I was a little too young it floated right by me
I never dreamed love so fulfilling it's simply killing and over spilling on me
It goes on and on ... 

This ain't no ordinary love
Gonna tell everyone up under the sun

I refuse to believe we're a dying breed
Children of peace hope and harmony
Ordinary folks extraordinary love
Something from above
Something we fall short of
You can't see with an untrained eye 
But if you take a little time you are sure to find it
We complicate something so basic 
But once you taste it you gonna chase it like me

Feels like looking at a magazine.
You learn,

Feels like dancing is the way to go.

show her that you're not that shy.
Let her see that fancy footwork,
show her you're that type of guy.

won't be late.
This girl ain't really got time to wait.

show her that you're not that shy.

Eso te pasó, atrevido
Eso te pasó por no saber que todo tiene su precio atrevido
Eso te pasó por no saber, atrevido
Hey nah nah
Comenzaré yo a relatarles esta historia y no es de hadas
Leyenda que contaba chulo viejo de barrio en barrio
Boca a Boca, en la calzada
A los oídos del curioso rellenaba

Ah había una vez, una pareja desprovista poca vista sin dinero
Pensando atónito, tónico, crónico como vivir
Salir del negro fango que le ahogaba
Tramaban, andaban, entre besos una cámara silente
Para un estúpido tupido cliente
Que de vivo mira el punto de las daba
Estaba, andaba vigilando a la criolla de carnada

Eso te pasó por no saber que todo tiene su precio atrevido
Eso te pasó, atrevido
Eso te pasó por no saber que todo tiene su precio atrevido
Eso te pasó por no saber, atrevido

Y el punto se tiró de gil
A buscarla a la guarida vida
Pasó que en la guajira mira
Era más bruta que una mula lomo arriba

Vengo yo de tal manera

Que que que esta historia echa candela
Te la voy a hacer bien breve
Para que no te me aceleres
Oíste asere, todo lo que ella pedía
el punto la complacía y escucha lo que le decía

Todo lo que le pedía
El punto se la gastaba
Oh, una linda habitación en el Cohiba
El punto se la gastaba
Hay un vestido para ella,
Hay un vestido para ella,
Una camisa pa' mi
El punto se la gastaba
Si quería ir a la playa
El punto se la gastaba
Ya la cuenta no le daba, no le daba
El punto se la gastaba
Al concierto con Orishas a vacilar
El punto se la gastaba

Poner sus botas, rotas
Rompe la puerta, loca
Tumba una copa, copas
El ruido alarma al vecindario,
Pasa muy a menudo aquí en mi barrio
Continua Pepe el legendario
Sigue a su misión, con discreción
Roba todo lo que llama la atención
Busca a su chica, pura emoción
A los consortes del bando
Pues Pepe ya salió del fango

Aunque tenga que decírtelo a la cara
No me voy a limitar
Te creíste que eras vivo,
Que mi chica te ganabas
Ahora ves, te deje sin nada
Sin chica para bailar
Ni lujo pa' impresionar
Te pasó, por no pensar
Que los demás también ganan
Y por gracias al señor
No te rastrillé la cara

Smoked what was left of your cigarette
Sit by the phone just in case you call me
It ain't ringing yet
You're probably half way to Albuquerque
You'll hang a north up to Santa Fe
You'll never know just how much it hurt me
To watch you walk away

From my blue bedroom
I've got a sad and lonely view
Of a melancholy moon
My pillow smells like your perfume
Missing you in my blue bedroom

You never told me why you were leaving
I guess you did what you had to do
If you find that love is what you're needing
It's waiting here for you

From my blue bedroom
I've got a sad and lonely view
Of a melancholy moon
My pillow smells like your perfume
Missing you in my blue bedroom

You left a red dress, some purple shoes
That silver comb that you never used
A yellow ribbon from your hair
Baby you're still everywhere

Missing you
I'm needing you

And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Jewel box life diamond nights and ruby lights, high in the sky
Heaven help him, when he falls
Diamond life, lover boy
He move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

Melts all your memories and change into gold

A condemned club for both weak and poor.

Let the present lead. Head my inner bleed.

My acts of foolishness. Victimize the perpetual soil.
I, I, I, I die alone.

Screaming, fighting and tearing my inside.
Screaming fight in me.

Down below the cars in the city go rushing by,
I see it here alone and I wonder why,

I search for the beat in this dirty town,

Downtown the young ones are going,
Downtown the young ones are growing,

Everybody live for the music around,

The music gets faster,
Look boy don't check on your watch, Not another glance,
I'm not leaving now honey not a chance,
Hot shot give me no problems,
Much later baby you'll be, saying ""nevermind,""
You know life is cruel,
Life is never kind,

Kind hearts don't make a new story,
Kind hearts don't grab any glory,

Outside suburbia calling, everywhere,

Jazz,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Punk,"Get me out of here.
This isn't slowing down.
We've hit black ice and lost control.
We're spinning faster now.
Tell me are we flying? Are we falling to the ground?
If tomorrow doesn't come, did we die for nothing?

Recounting past events has helped reveal that you don't give a damn 
about the days when you would live the words you wrote.
Not the person who you were; I hate the person you've become.
You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing.

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

You said you started up this home 
because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run.
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.
If you had then where were you?
We've payed our dues without you.

Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?
Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through.
I am nothing like you!

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

This is The Fallen

This is the last time you will have us.
You're lawless and purely dishonest.
A scandal that we have funded for you.
Make no mistake this all is about you.

No, we never knew.
(This is the last time you will have us.)
Don't buy what they sell you.
(You're lawless and purely dishonest.)
No, we never knew.
(A scandal that we have funded for you.)
Don't buy what they sell you.
(Make no mistake this all is about you.)

But I can't stop feeling love for this place we both came from. 
I will never lose my youth.
All of this is too unforgettable.

Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling...

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.

Somehow it seems
We've shed our dream but we're
Time after time in a room full of strangers
Out of the blue, suddenly you were there


Wherever I go you're the glow of temptation,

Glancing my way in the grey of the dawn

And always your smile holds that strange invitation

Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect

They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul

Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school

You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band

Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC

I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean

Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's

Country,"(Feat. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson) 
I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",6.75,8.555555555555555

A hundred years from today

So laugh and sing, make love the thing

Be happy while you may

There's always one, beneath the sun

The moon is shining, and that's a good sign

Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine

I guess it's time for me to let you go,
And I've been thinkin' about you,

And you reach the other side safely,
Could you smile a little smile for me?

Why do you still waste my time
Who gives a fuck just what you think

Somebody showed me there's a little thing to take me there
My mother warned me about this little thing, but I dont care

Mind your life, I'll do the same
Go back from where in which you came
You want to try to push your weight
Expect a fist right in the face
All your lies and social crimes
And circumstances you deny
Give your piss a special prize
And see them try to blow me away

I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-
You say hello, little did I know...

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-
And I was crying on the staircase-
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
Oh, Oh.

Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -
but you were everything to me-
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said...

Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes-

Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Oh, Oh.

I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said...

Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...

Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.

Watch out homeboy, don't let it catch you

Turn around, get ready, keep your eye on the prize
And be on point for the future shock

So stay alert, don't let them get you down
They tell you times are tough, you hear that times are hard
But when you work for that ace you know you pulled the right card
Hard times got our pockets all in chains

All day I have to work at my peak
Beacuse I need that dollar every day of the weak

Hard times can take you on a natural trip
So keep your balance, and don't you slip
Hard times is nothing new on me

Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,

When my heart is still with you,

And ol' midnight knows it, too.

When a quarrel we had needs mending,

Does it mean that our love is ending.

Darlin' I need you, lately I find

You're out of my heart,

And I'm out of my mind.

Recounting past events has helped reveal that you don't give a damn 
about the days when you would live the words you wrote.
Not the person who you were; I hate the person you've become.
You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing.

A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

You said you started up this home 
because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run.
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.
If you had then where were you?
We've payed our dues without you.

Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?
Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through.
I am nothing like you!

You're lawless and purely dishonest.

Are secret spies, as the tension grows
Deep down inside, I know they're coming for me

Have to find a way
Don't care what it takes
I shall persevere

Confused in this maze, no chance to escape

She puts on her makeup and drives to the bar in her

Whatever comes first or whatever looks best

Country,"See the ruin on the hill, where the smoke is hanging still,
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,

How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game

In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed

You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)

I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past

And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid

Buy now, I kill for a living
I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock

Contrast bohemia to my workplace
When I'm racing in carpool lane
to sell shit to an art school lame
-Don't you think you're hot shit
Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number

Buy now
You crazy chicks

Cuz I don't pay attention to rules,
regulations or safety tips
Love us
Eligible bachelors
Love us
Cuz we're the Blowed rappers
Loved
Cuz I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

Of the tragedies in man 
Lurking in the core of us all 
The last dying call for the everlost 
Brief encounters, bleeding pain 
Lepers coiled neath the trees 

Dying men in bewildered soliloquys 

Perversions bloom round the bend 

Seekers, lost in their quest 

Ghosts of friends frolic 

under the waning moon 

It is the year of death 

Wielding his instruments 

Stealth sovereign reaper 

Touching us with ease 

Infecting the roots in an instant 

Burning crop of disease 

I am just a spectator 

An advocate documenting the loss 

Fluttering with conceit 

This doesn't concern me yet 

Still far from the knell 

Taunting their bereavement 

Mod round the dead 

Point fingers at the details 

Probing vomits for more 

Caight in unbridled suspense 

We have all lost it now 

Catching the flakes of dismay 

Born the travesty of man 

Regular pulse midst pandemonium 

You're plucked to the mass 

Parched with thirst for the wicked 

Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark 

The sun sets forever over Blackwater park",1.1666666666666667,4.714285714285714

When my heart is still with you,

And ol' midnight knows it, too.

When a quarrel we had needs mending,

Does it mean that our love is ending.

You're out of my heart,

And I'm out of my mind.

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

Country,"(Feat. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson) 
I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and
around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",6.75,8.555555555555555
Pop,"Just before I tell you standing in the rain 
I would have loved you like no other babe
But a poet needs his pain
And sometimes life can be so cruel
It will pick you up and drop you down again
So if you try to love me darling please refrain
I'm still searching for the pieces
Someone else once took away
You know I used to love with all my heart
But how the times they can change.

Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart.

I've seen a lot of heartache and I've walked a lonely road
They say the darkest times before the dawn
But the rooster hasn't crowed
And when you wake up in the morning
Oh my darling I'll be gone

Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart
No I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart.

So many fools fall in love
And it's a crying game
It's a crying shame
That I'm not a fool in love
But I know what I'm feeling 
And my heart is still healing

Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart

And the many times he lied
I'll tell you 'cause I know
You can make it on your own

So your heart belongs to you now
And you know that it's right
Free from that make believe love story
In your mind (in your mind, in your mind)
Feel so much better, leaving yesterday behind
But always remember, hold on to life

So for all of your regrets
That your poor heart won't let you forget
I can tell you 'cause I know
You can make it on your own

You'll be wiser in the morning
So much stronger when the sun rises
So don't find your fear alarming
Your pain will disappear like nightfall
Will then rain comes, the pain goes
Wash it away
The remains of a battered soul
Trouble won't' last always
Believe me there'll be brighter days

We all have ways of finding out the things we don't know

Well I can breathe it in and see the darkness all around
I see things every day in every way
Unleashed unchained and unrestrained so I can say
the death and hate I see I'll bring it to the ground
I can breathe it in and bring entire systems down

Break through baby I've never felt this good
Because I know I've seen what the others should have to see
Who left the light in these blinded eyes?
Street wise soldier I always thought I would bring back
the fight our mothers and fathers could
They rocked the system and changed their lives

I turned my face away
it's the only way to see what I am
so I don't have to breathe

And now I see the sights I had on the are now on me
Tell me when did I go wrong?
Have I been this heartless and selfish and fucked up all along?
How did lose proof?
Did I forget to reach the youth and expose the truth?
But now instead of all the things I thought I shed
The only thing I can really see is that I am already dead

One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me

If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

Graceful and strong, No more forlorn
Today's a jubilee
Don't be surprised
This change is my design

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

Do they wash away the flames the wind and the searing rains
As our powers interchange

The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go'round

And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it ?
Hmmm

It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel

When Tom came home his hair was combed
He bought snakeskin boots in Rome
That's not like him
His socks are clean, his shirt is pressed
It isn't just the way he's dressed
He smiles out of context and acts so polite
He's staying at his cousin's overnight
The protein shakes, that's not like him
The carrot cakes, that's not like him
The oatbran flakes, that's not like him
And the sweet name he called me in his sleep last night
Oh, that's not like him

He whispers on the telephone
He goes out smelling of cologne
That's not like him
It's just a superficial thing
But he's misplaced his wedding ring
He's become quite a connoisseur of wine
He's quoting Yeats and Gertrude Stein
The Soho pub, that's not like him
The racquet club, that's not like him
Those books on love, that's not like him
And the sweet name he called me in his sleep last night
Oh, that's not like him

I caught a glimpse of Tom today
At a checkout counter, about to pay
He had a girl on his arm
I'm glad he's helping out the poor
It's not like the Tom I knew before
Something so touching it made me cry
But my heart was racing, I don't know why
Those new blue suede shoes, that's not like him
The Ray Ban shades, that's not like him
Those downtown ways, that's not like him
And the sweet name he called me in his sleep last night
Oh, that's not like him

The red suspenders, that's not like him
The berries in the blender, that's not like him
Those twelve step groups, that's not like him
And Guadeloupe, that's not like him
Those books on Zen, that's not like him
The Karate classes, that's not like him
The fishing gear, that's not like him
Not like him, That's not like him",11.25,7.088888888888889

Where do we go from here
What do I do with these feelings
Longing to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

[Verse 1:]
Why must the bad things always feel so good
Why can't I just stay away
Thought our situation was understood, still does not mean it's okay

Where do we go from here
What do I do with these feelings
Longing to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

[Lalah:]
Why can't these memories just be erased
Why must I yearn for your kiss
The first moment we're not face to face
Reminds me how much your missed
Where do we go

Where do we go from here

Longing to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

When the morning comes
When it's time for us to go our separate ways
When this night is done, I be wanting to hold onto you
Ooooh the sun, I wish we could push it all away
Cause then we'll know that we can show what we have from the day

Where do we go from here (I need to know, I need to know)
What do I do with these feelings
Longinh to have you near
Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

I need to know where do we gooooo oh
I know I should walk away something keeps telling me one mo day

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

And watch the price of gasoline rise with the price of fame

Drifting further every day 
Getting lost within myself

Simply nothing more to give 
There is nothing more for me

Missing one inside of me

Cannot stand this hell I feel

To the point of agony 
Growing darkness taking dawn

Don't forget that I

Was the one that you found
And if I know you
You'll find me someplace new
I hope I never, I hope I never have to
We're a waste of time
And if I know you, learned long ago it's true
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

Go and explain, explain it again, boy that this all started
Found you lying in the arms of another girl
So stop your crying
Day after day, year after year
Far too long it lasted
You must have thought I was nothing without you boy
Don't forget that I

Was the one that you found
And if I know you
You'll find me someplace new
I hope I never, I hope I never have to
We're a waste of time
And if I know you, learned long ago it's true
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

And tonight, if we learn that the world's on fire
I guess I'll turn to you
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

I fail to find
So hard to find
And I can't find a way for you and I to go far...(?)

I'm always learning things the hard, hard, hardest way.

Cos I was the one, that you found
And if I know you, you'll find me someplace new
I hope you never, I hope you never get to

Tonight, if we learn that the world's on fire
I guess I'll turn to you
I hope I never, I hope I never have to",4.8,7.479166666666667

Yeah ... ha, uh huh
You know how we do (we're gonna do how we do)
Uh, uh, yo my nigga Cad what's hangin nigga (gangsta shit)
Nigga Terry what's goin on nigga
Let me talk to 'em for a minute (Murder Inc. bosses in the building)
Yeah, haha

[Chorus]
Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about the benjamins and nobody ain't doin it like us
C'mon what y'all want?

Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about sex, money, and murder
Bitches that burn ya, niggas with burners
Cocked and let go!

[Verse 1]
Fuck all y'all motherfuckin bitch ass niggas
I'm talkin to whoever wanna be ridin my dick
And you know your gon' get it as hot as I spit it
It's the Rule and nobody wanna be bothered with
If I hit 'em in every direction with four fifths
Will expend like 45's with compact discs (c'mon)
It's a disappointment to see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed
When I'm one of rap's anointed
Who else used to order it all on the dick
Like when I come through with spinners on the six
And got bitches bouncin like Ronnie in Tricks
But some whores in this game really don't make sense
Bomb roof and via Cal's and clonin Ems
But when bullets go through your film, we break your limbs
A horror show, yeah picture this
Cause I guess you can't see it, it's Murder again

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Rule I fuck with bitches in Manolos and thick Louie Vuitton logos
Cause I don't love these hoes
I'm above and beyond everything that your seein
And I'm the only real nigga left rappin this freakin
If I could be one of the seasons, you'd call me summer
The way I bang the heater out the back of the Hummer
The bull just move like runners from city block to city block
Layin down the foundation for what's really hot
Y'all niggas really not on my level (c'mon)
I'm like slugs when they pierce the metal, you see sparks (what)
My voice is a brush, they hear it it's like art
And nobody can really tell the twins apart
I call one Nina, other one Santa Maria
I might roll up on your set, dump and lean ya
My bitch is cocked to bang men in Virginia
Don't make me run up on ya, put a few in ya

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yo, Murder's outlaw, that guess I get a city's a broads
So I push the Porsche high and truck to court
Holla at the judge if the judge made a bad decision
I feel like the nigga that triggerin guns with mittens
It's hard to get done, I'm hearin that security runs
around 30K, if they don't get hit with an AK
And found out that the security's runnin another way
Like with me, it's Murder, probably
If I could drop in to manslaughter get a bail and flee
Cause my downess says bitch up, let her handle the pick up
Snow cone the country leave no market untouched
Call me drugs if this is how they pushin us rafters
But I don't do it cause I need it, I do it cause I want more
Definition is greed, I do it cause I want yours
And y'all niggas is teasin, y'all don't really want war
But if you really do, your gonna need a lot more

I'm a stranger in paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry-eyed
That's the danger in paradise
For mortals who stand beside an angel like you

I saw your face and I ascended
Out of the commonplace into the rare
Somewhere in space I hang suspended
Until I know there's a chance that you care

Won't you answer this fervent prayer
Of a stranger in paradise?
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for

But open your angel's arms
To this stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no more",4.75,5.684210526315789

Pop,"What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?
I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping

Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion

Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
but darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
and I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need...

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Everytime I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
let it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming
Begging, pleading
No more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, Oh

I'm about to break

I'm addicted to your allure

Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, Oh

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this moment
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I say...
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

Only thing I need to do is walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Rock,"There in the afterglow
My solo world in view
A glimpse beyond the world I know
An open door that I walk through?
And falling from the sky,
a tear before the rain.
But it will pass me by -
holding back again...

A man possessed wings to fly
beyond this space and time
The rhythm of this heart of mine
Is beating like a battle cry

And if I let it go
Will strength provide relief
from fearful winds that blow -
only disbelief

Tears falling
I'm calling
out into the air
My sun is rising where I stand - (I know)

One day I wake up
and suddenly I'm found
High flying man has been unbound (and so)

the hourglass is winding down
as all becomes so clear

now tears that fall are all around
and rainbows in the sky appear

Tears falling
I'm calling
out into the air
My sun is rising where I stand - (I know)

and suddenly I'm found
High flying man has been unbound (and so)

And here I am once more
I'm standing in the light

I took my view 
Over the downtowns 
On the avenues 
Where the streets are wide 
And the people thrive 
And its further to fall down 
Cause you fly so high

I've never seen such clear skies 
I've never seen such high hopes 
I've never seen such tired eyes 

And I wish that I could be 
Everything you are 
Everything you are 

Down in the delta 
The city wakes 
Turns on the TV 
As the ... 

Where the streets are burned 
From the hot summer sun 
And there's nowhere to run to 
When your time has come 

I've never seen such a beauty 
I've never seen such clear skies 
I've never seen such high hopes 
I've never seen such tired eyes 

Open wounds of piece by piece 
All those flesh all over me 
Take my pills and went to sleep 
Oh, and I sang myself to sleep 

And I wish that I could be 
Everything you are 
Everything you are 
And I wish that I could see 
The world the way you do 
As selfishly as you 

Oooh 

And I wish that I could be 
Everything you are 
Everything you are 
And I wish that I could stick 
My faith the way you do 
As certainly as you

The sky is going to fall on you 
The sky is going to fall on you 
On you, on you. 
The sky is going to fall on you

We've got to be on time, to meet old Number Four.
So sling the coal, we'll make it, boy, or never ride no more.

Heading for his mother dear, who on her death-bed lay;
He raised a weary hand, to brush away a tear,
Not knowing his last drive was run, and Fate was drawing near.

When through the darkened night, a headlight bright did gleam,
O'er the roar of rolling wheels, a whistle load did scream;
As down around the curve, the mighty train did roar,
With black smoke rolling from the stack, came Flyer Number Four.

Then came an awful crash! Their last long drive was run,
On the track the hobo lay, his days of life were done;
And as the golden sun, sank slowly to the west,

From the look on his face and the size of his toes

Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee
He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie
He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky
He says they'll come get him, come get him some day

He says where he's from is called Albertane
There they use more than 10% of the brain
But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave
They run around in underwear and they never shave

Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky

This is you, your lifeless soul.
Your sick and fucked-up lies.
In my world your love is death.
Your disease, your skin that burns.

You tied my limbs and buried me alive.
And piled this frozen mud.

Out of the commonplace into the rare

From all that I hunger for

Whatever..
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fuck it 
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 
in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..
I don't know you and no, 
I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
No patience is in me and if you offend me 
I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air 
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe

I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

with all of this nonsense it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content -
- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me (finger at me)..
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty

to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk 
with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin 
the same fuckin questions (fuckin questions)..
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out
cause they drivin me crazy (drivin me crazy).. I can't take it 
I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit

Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,

Find a way to get in, the fit in the ghetto
You get out, wit out a dime

When people get married they always have a dance
The music is grand with a samba band
The people are carried away with such romance

Olay! Olay! The Wedding Samba

Will bring a pretty senorita to her feet

And when they play The Wedding Samba

She'll say ""I do"" and seal it with a samba beat



So that's how it goes in fiesta time

The beat of a samba is always in the air

And every one knows it's fiesta time

And joins in the samba around the happy pair",1.3,7.615384615384615

About a half a glass left for the road
Here's a toast to the time we were lovers---then I'll go
Should I laugh, or should I cry
Love you, hate you, live or die
Is my heart half full or half empty
Is our love like the wine in this glass
You drink like there's no tomorrow
So sure, it will always last
Will the memories tase sweet as they linger
Or the bitterness stay on my tongue
Is my heart half full of the love you gave me
Or my heart half empty cuz your love is gone

Your bags are all packed in the hallway
The boxes are stacked on the lawn
You kiss me goodbye just like always
And you're gone
Trembling hands or nerves of steel
Someone tell me what to feel

Is my heart half full or half empty
Is our love like the wine in this glass

Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 
in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..
I don't know you and no, 
I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
No patience is in me and if you offend me 
I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air

and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me (finger at me)..
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty

to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations

Country,"See the ruin on the hill, where the smoke is hanging still,
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,
To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,
And the silhouette was seen for miles around.
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,
But it only took one night to bring it down,

Oh what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I coming to see her real soon I hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast

And socially at the platform that the timetable forgot
Picking up used tickets in a station of have-nots

You pass some pretty funky stops
When you're on that train of thought
You pass some pretty funky stops

Picking up the things we cannot see
A bicycle, a dame, a Christmas tree
Things of no value to you or me

Here comes Pockets
Reduced through history to just a crawl
History turns the tall into the small
But natural born trawlers love to trawl

And the guitar of his dreams hangs upon some wall
Or laying underneath the staircase in a hall
We can carry dreams but we can't hold them all
That's why we learn the Blues before we actually fall

Railroad Bill, the engineer said, ""Boy, we'll have to fly!""
We've got to be on time, to meet old Number Four.
So sling the coal, we'll make it, boy, or never ride no more.
While in the rear boxcar, a lonely hobo lay,
Heading for his mother dear, who on her death-bed lay;
He raised a weary hand, to brush away a tear,
Not knowing his last drive was run, and Fate was drawing near.

When through the darkened night, a headlight bright did gleam,
O'er the roar of rolling wheels, a whistle load did scream;
As down around the curve, the mighty train did roar,
With black smoke rolling from the stack, came Flyer Number Four.

Then came an awful crash! Their last long drive was run,
On the track the hobo lay, his days of life were done;
And as the golden sun, sank slowly to the west,
His dear old mother gently smiled, and closed her eyes in death.",5.333333333333333,10.75

Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise
But the heart rules the mind
And the going gets rough
Pride takes the fall
When you find that kind of love

I can't help feeling like a fool
Since I lost that place inside
Where my heart knew its way
And my soul was ever wise
Once innocence was lost
There was not faith enough
Still my heart held on
When it found that kind of love

Though beauty is rare enough
Still we trust
Somehow we'll find it there
With no guarantee
It seems to me
At least it should be fair

But if it's only tears and pain
Isn't it still worth the cost
Like some sweet saving grace
Or a river we must cross
If we don't understand
What this life is made of
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love
Cause when innocence is lost
There is not faith enough
We learn the truth
When we find that kind of love",8.75,5.285714285714286

I need her sharing her world beside me 

So I've got to be there 
Got to be there in the morning 
And welcome her into my world 
And show her that she is my girl 
When she says, ""Hello world!"" 
I need her sharing the world beside me 

That's why I've got to be there 
Got to be there where love begins 
And that's everywhere she goes 
I've got to be there so she knows 
That when she's with me, she's home

Watch out homeboy, don't let it catch you
P-p-prices go up, don't let your pocket go down
When you got short money you're stuck on the ground
Turn around, get ready, keep your eye on the prize
And be on point for the future shock

Hard times [repeat 2x]

Hard times are coming to your town
So stay alert, don't let them get you down
They tell you times are tough, you hear that times are hard
But when you work for that ace you know you pulled the right card
Hard times got our pockets all in chains
I'll tell you what, homeboy, it don't have my brain
All day I have to work at my peak
Beacuse I need that dollar every day of the weak

Hard times

Hard times can take you on a natural trip
So keep your balance, and don't you slip
Hard times is nothing new on me
I'm gonna use my strong mentality
Like the cream of the crop, like the crop of the cream
B-b-beating hard times, that is my theme
Hard times in life, hard times in death
I'm gonna keep on fighting to my very last breath

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

This isn't slowing down.
We've hit black ice and lost control.
We're spinning faster now.
Tell me are we flying? Are we falling to the ground?
If tomorrow doesn't come, did we die for nothing?

Recounting past events has helped reveal that you don't give a damn 
about the days when you would live the words you wrote.
Not the person who you were; I hate the person you've become.
You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing.

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

You said you started up this home 
because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run.
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.
If you had then where were you?
We've payed our dues without you.

Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?
Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through.
I am nothing like you!

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

This is the last time you will have us.
You're lawless and purely dishonest.
A scandal that we have funded for you.
Make no mistake this all is about you.

No, we never knew.

Don't buy what they sell you.
(You're lawless and purely dishonest.)
No, we never knew.
(A scandal that we have funded for you.)
Don't buy what they sell you.
(Make no mistake this all is about you.)

But I can't stop feeling love for this place we both came from. 
I will never lose my youth.
All of this is too unforgettable.

Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling love.
Some stop feeling...

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Watch out homeboy, don't let it catch you

Turn around, get ready, keep your eye on the prize
And be on point for the future shock

Hard times are coming to your town
So stay alert, don't let them get you down
They tell you times are tough, you hear that times are hard
But when you work for that ace you know you pulled the right card
Hard times got our pockets all in chains
I'll tell you what, homeboy, it don't have my brain
All day I have to work at my peak
Beacuse I need that dollar every day of the weak

Hard times can take you on a natural trip
So keep your balance, and don't you slip
Hard times is nothing new on me

Yo... it's like waking up from a bad dream
Just to figure out you weren't dreaming in the first place
[Verse 1:]
If all I saw was gangsters
Coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung ta
Claim ta, unrolled myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap
I'm amongst tha
Streets deceiving
Can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata
Persona's that of a non-needer
Because I don't need nada except for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
To my g's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix
Caked up, tryna take what I'm eating
Came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy mouth
Wild, hardly
A man's man
Who woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebel's and Stella McCartney's
For years, all that
How could I not be dead
This old German
Said I was a thug with a notty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see
From my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme
My stories is I'm from the home of the thieves

[Verse 2:]
Blessed
The lord is a g, he gotta be
Who's the God of suckers and snitches
The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe
Blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive
Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder
Black cop cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers, athletes, and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances, trends, and fashion
But when it comes to residuals, they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tee's, blue jeans, and red bandanas

[Verse 3:]
Assassinations
Diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people
Built a new nation
Involuntary labor
Took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby
Let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700's
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite
Through your covenant
Love to sit in on the Senate
And tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair
She read about herself in the bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron
Like bring me my dinner, dear
She the nigger here
Ain't we in the free world

Bugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me

Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till

Well I can breathe it in and see the darkness all around
I see things every day in every way
Unleashed unchained and unrestrained so I can say
the death and hate I see I'll bring it to the ground
I can breathe it in and bring entire systems down

Break through baby I've never felt this good
Because I know I've seen what the others should have to see
Who left the light in these blinded eyes?
Street wise soldier I always thought I would bring back
the fight our mothers and fathers could
They rocked the system and changed their lives

I turned my face away
it's the only way to see what I am
so I don't have to breathe

And now I see the sights I had on the are now on me
Tell me when did I go wrong?
Have I been this heartless and selfish and fucked up all along?
How did lose proof?
Did I forget to reach the youth and expose the truth?
But now instead of all the things I thought I shed
The only thing I can really see is that I am already dead

Pop,"Last night, I was dreaming 
I was locked in a prison cell 
When I woke up, I was screaming 
Calling out your name 
(bridge 1) 
And the judge and the jury 
They all put the blame on me 
They wouldn't go for my story 
They wouldn't hear my plea 

(chorus) 
Only you can set me free 
'Cos I'm guilty (guilty) 
Guilty as a girl can be 
Come on baby can't you see 
I stand accused of love in the first degree 

Guilty, of love in the first degree 

Someday, I believe it 
You will come to my rescue 
Unchain my heart you're keeping 
And let me start anew 

(bridge 2) 
The hours pass so slowly 
Since they've thrown away the key 
Can't you see that I'm lonely 
Won't you help me please 

(chorus) 

Guilty, of love in the first degree 

Guilty, of love 
Guilty, of love in 
Guilty, of love 
Guilty, of love in 
Guilty, of love in the first degree

Country,"An old man was sitting at his table one day
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I coming to see her real soon I hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last

The postman was passing and picked up the note
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke
Straight up into heaven this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know",5.0,9.2

I yearn and toss and turn, every time I find myself missing you
Rain falls your sound is wet, don't feel as wet when ain't inside of you
Your skin is so a silhouette, at the stroke of my finger tips
Cause I hope your not the prototype, but the makings of the real deal
See it's been some time been some time since you came around
So I recognize just what I feel

It's that old four letter word that I feel you, when I touch you yeah
It's that old four letter word that I taste, when I kiss you yeah
It's that old four letter word that I recognize, so familiar yeah
It's that old four letter word Love love love love love love love

I feel sexy and confident, when I illuminate in your eyesight
I feel speechless and spellbound, so what's the use of even tryin' to put up the fight
I let down all my guards, you persuaded me when u did the same
I'm through it, played all my cards; I found a higher ground, a higher place
See it's been some time been some time, I know where u been, I been waitin on ya
But welcome back, I hope you're here to stay, here to stay
I always here about, sing about, even write about ya
Just know I had ya till ya slipped away

A love like ours is blind

I realize, there's no compromise
Through lion eyes, I love for (?)
Just wasn't there, even though I care
Did I hurt you back / bad (?), did I make you sad
I know I paid (?), that's why I'm alone today
Just me myself, no mental health
My mistake overtakes
Your love's overgrown my love

My love, my love, my love for you
My love, my love, my love for you

Now I wonder why, until we die
And then upon the praise
Hope Jesus come to kill the man / mourn (?)

I feel again, I love you then
Oceans of time, a cross divine
I found you, I will find you
That is not my time, my time to take

Rap,"[Eminem]
Whatever..
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fuck it 
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 
in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..
I don't know you and no, 
I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
No patience is in me and if you offend me 
I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air 
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (of all you)..
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me

Chorus: Eminem

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

[Eminem]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content -
- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me (finger at me)..
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty
havin this happenin (this happenin)..
then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way)..
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire 
to burn and it's burnin and I have returned

Chorus

[Eminem]
I'm so sick and tired of bein admired
that I wish that I would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is..""
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk 
with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin 
the same fuckin questions (fuckin questions)..
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out
cause they drivin me crazy (drivin me crazy).. I can't take it 
I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for ev-ery fan that I get
But I can't take a SHIT, in the bathroom
without someone standin by it
No I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

Country,"That innocent look in her green eyes
Sparkle when she stars to laugh
Memories of her start to fill up my mind
Like pieces of torn photographs
It's all coming back to me now
I thought I'd forget her somehow
But my mind can't forget what
My heart won't allow
It's all coming back to me now

That desperate look in her green eyes
When she said ""Goodbye"" in the rain
It tears me to pieces, I have to recall
How I caused her all of that pain

And it's all coming back to me now

But my mind can't forget what
My heart won't allow
