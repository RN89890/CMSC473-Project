[Intro Two: Masta Killa]

It's assassi, it's assination day, I stalk...

It's assassination, I sta...

It's assassination day... 

It's assassination day, I



[Verse One: Inspectah Deck]

Ryzarector, Madman, uh, uhh, yo, uhh

I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light

Invite the fight, we all die tonight

The life I lived, a 25 to life bid

Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive

CREAM is short, C-cypher power stalk plus the fiend talk

Three G's accost in Supreme Court

White lies and blackmail land me back in jail

We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail

Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind

It comes time I take back what was once mine

Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter

Devil's poisonin the birth water

The earth daughter rest her head on my chest

Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest

While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blastin

Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened, shhhh

Trapped in deep-water gaspin

I Clash With the Titans from my half on the action



[Verse Two: RZA]

I stop producers careers, the weak spot was their ears

Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears

You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered

Devils still peeled it still they're living built tilted

MC's upon their axis, their body has a tactic

Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice

You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable

One nation under God, indivisible

With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches

Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches

Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel

Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable

Interchangable, caution flameable

My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable, angles

And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle

Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal

Retrieve through your doors

Seep out like sweat through the pores

Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare



[Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef]

(Assassination day)

First of all, before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon

Don, spread it out like Grey Poupon

Splurgin, mergin in the suburbs, using this just like an adverb

Action word, flowing like a blackbird

God came in, aimin like Terry Bradshaw

He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pah

You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga

Hold on like bullet-proof Acuras

You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high

Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shootin it like they blew top snow

You won't play me like your lady

Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby

Final destination Haiti



[Verse Four: Masta Killa]

War is extremely serious and it saddens me

To have to take tings to deadly measures

And have you measured and shot for no pay

It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey

Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives

And lures MC's to the lair

With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed

Temptation tempts my victim to proceed

Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat

You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat

Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in 

Murdereous rhymin, constantly in climbin

My mind spits with an enormous kickback

Your brain didn't absorb the impact

Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback...



It's assassination day, I

It's assassination day

It's assassination day

It's assassination day, I stalk my enemy

It's assassination day, I stalk my enemy",Rap

What do you see on the news when you watch T.V.
War in the name of God, or a playground killing spree
Politicians promise you the world, and a preacher cries
All he ever wanted was your money, and a bitch on the side

What went wrong? Did society twist him?



What do you see in the center of the public eye

Rock stars on smack, and a serial killer fries

Radicals blame suicide and murder on our from of art

Brainwash the youth, you know they claim we all play a part

What a shame that they can't think for themselves



Past tense to future tense let history unfold

So ends a decade now what will the nineties hold

You know we're verging on the edge of an age

Then another century will turn the page



What do you think they will say when they look back on this

Were the eighties just a time of spoiled innocence

We leave our legacy like dust in the sands of time

Let's hope the seeds we plant can carry the weight of our crimes



Past tense to future tense let history unfold

And when we're old and gray these stories will be told

You know we're verging on the edge of an age

Then another century will turn the page



We sail an ocean, a sea of doubt

Skeptics make no sense, can't work things out

I'll choose optimism, scream its name

Look to the future, a burning flame



Past tense to future tense let history unfold

So ends a decade now what will the nineties hold

You know we're verging on the edge of an age

Then another century will turn the page

Take what you want

I know I'm not wrong

I know what you want from me

Take what you want



Truth will rear it's ugly head

Cruel and brutal words you said

Then you say you're done

You're way too smart for your own good

To let you have your fun

You've walked on me, it's understood

You've run my life too long

I know I'm not wrong

I know what you want from me

Take what you want

I won't give you anything

Take what you want



Cover your face

Hide your eyes

And act like nothing's wrong

You'll need a better disguise

Though it won't be long

You always give yourself away

When you try to change your voice

But it's what you say and how you say it

That leaves me with no choice

But it's what you say and how you say it

That leaves me with no choice



I know that's you haunting me

I know I'm not wrong

I don't owe you anything

Take what you want

Take what you want

We must escape
Our darkest days
Or face the fall
And fade away



We must escape

Our darkest days

Or face the fall

And fade away



There is a place to mourn

Where all the angels pray

And if I close my eyes

I'll see you there again someday



We have been torn apart

Left with our fragile hearts

Still it's yours that's not beating anymore tonight



Darkness is broken by the flame of our love

Lost were we all and still through this we survived



We must escape

Our darkest days

Or face the fall

And fade away



For you we drown in tears

Our sorrow kills our fears

I'll drink the blood from your poisoned heart to be with you

"See the ruin on the hill, where the smoke is hanging still,
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones,
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
Cecil Darby loved his wife, and he laboured all his life,

To provide her with material possessions.

And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.

And the building soon became his sole obsession.



Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,

And the silhouette was seen for miles around.

And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,

But it only took one night to bring it down,

When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.



Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,

In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.

For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,

And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.



Then one night he heard a sound, as he laid his pencil down,

And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.

And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,

Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.



Oh, it took three-hundred days, for the timbers to be raised,

And the silhouette was seen for miles around.

And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky,

But it only took one night to bring it down,

When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.",Country

"High on the bell tower 
I took my view 
Over the downtowns 
On the avenues 
Where the streets are wide 

And the people thrive 

And its further to fall down 

Cause you fly so high 



I've never seen such a beauty 

I've never seen such clear skies 

I've never seen such high hopes 

I've never seen such tired eyes 



And I wish that I could be 

Everything you are 

Everything you are 



Down in the delta 

The city wakes 

Turns on the TV 

As the ... 



Where the streets are burned 

From the hot summer sun 

And there's nowhere to run to 

When your time has come 



I've never seen such a beauty 

I've never seen such clear skies 

I've never seen such high hopes 

I've never seen such tired eyes 



Open wounds of piece by piece 

All those flesh all over me 

Take my pills and went to sleep 

Oh, and I sang myself to sleep 



And I wish that I could be 

Everything you are 

Everything you are 

And I wish that I could see 

The world the way you do 

As selfishly as you 



Oooh 



And I wish that I could be 

Everything you are 

Everything you are 

And I wish that I could stick 

My faith the way you do 

As certainly as you 



The sky is going to fall on you 

The sky is going to fall on you 

The sky is going to fall on you 

On you, on you. 

The sky is going to fall on you 

The sky.

"You know, I worked the Big Packet show in Fort Worth, Saturday night, 
We had all day Sunday to rest and relax, before I caught another flight. 
So I decided to walk down town an' get myself a little fresh air. 
Before long, I found myself in front of a big church on the corner of the square. 
Boy, I could hear that singin' way out in the street, sure was a beautiful sound. 

So I just walked up the steps an' opened the door an' started to go inside an' sit down. 

But before I could, a young man walked over to me an said: ""Excuse me, Sir, 

""But I can't let you in with that big black hat, those jeans, that beard an' long hair. 



So I just left, went back outside, sat down on that kerbing, an I thought to myself: 

That's the house of the Lord. That guy's got the hell of a nerve. 

Tellin' me I can't worship anywhere I please. 

So right there, in front of that Church, I just knelt down on my knees. 



I said: ""Lord, I know I don't look like much, but I didn't think you'd mind. 

""I just wanted to be with your people, Lord: it's been a long time. 

""A while ago, a saw a wino over there in the alley, all bent over in tears, 

""An' I thought how one stained glass window, from this Church, would feed his family for years."" 



""Then there's those fine cars parked outside: too many for me to count. 

""Made me think how people walked for days to hear your sermon on the mount. 

""Then there's those fine ladies in the choir, Lord, singin' like they really love it. 

""Hell, last night, they were dancin' on the front row of my show: drinkin' beer, screamin: 'Sing Shove It.' 



""You know, even John the Baptist wouldn't be welcome in this place, 

""With his coat made of Camel hair an' sandals on his feet an' a long beard on his face. 

""You know, Lord, when you come back to get your children, an' take 'em beyond the clouds, 

""To live forever in Heaven with you: well, I'd sure hate to be in this crowd. 



""You know, Lord, I'm not perfect; some even call me no count. 

""But I'll tell you: I believe a man is judged by what's in his heart, not what's in his bank account. 

""So if this is what religion is: a big car, a suit an' a tie, 

""Then I might as well forget it Lord, 'cause I can't qualify. 



""Oh, by the way, Lord, right before they kicked me out, didn't I see a picture of you? 

""With sandals an' a beard. Believe you had long hair too."" 

""Well, this is Paycheck, signing off. 

""I'll be seein' you Lord, I hope.""",Country

Get her second chance

Convinced she's lost all meaning

To say these words you need to hear

Don't let anybody tell you who you are (who you are)

It's okay to let go, you're that shooting star (shooting star)

Remember all you wished for

Believe it will be true

You will never find yourself anywhere else,

find yourself in you

Be like me to fit in

Do you know your identity is not in them



Don't be scared there's someone there

To say these words you need to hear

Why should I measure the world

By someone else's design

Oh I won't let this fly by

Now it's your turn to see

And the clouds all run away

And she brings a little sunshine

A shining star, she is by far

And when she gives me a smile or a touch

Who'd ever think little things mean so much.



Yesterday belongs to someone else

Today belongs to me

I guess that it's my turn at last to know

How sweet that love can be

It's thrilling love

A chilling love

An ever-warm phorphilling love

And in time, she will be mine.

"How I needed you
How I grieve now you're gone
In my dreams I see you
I awake so alone
I know you didn't want to leave

Your heart yearned to stay

But the strength I always loved in you

Finally gave way



Somehow I knew you would leave me this way

Somehow I knew you could never.. never stay

And in the early morning light

After a silent peaceful night

You took my heart away

And I grieve



In my dreams I can see you

I can tell you how I feel

In my dreams I can hold you

And it feels so real



I still feel the pain

I still feel your love

I still feel the pain

I still feel your love



And somehow I knew you could never, never stay

And somehow I knew you would leave me

And in the early morning light

After a silent peaceful night

You took my heart away

I wished, I wished you could have stayed",Rock

Broken bones Matilda left a note and a rose
Sayin', ""Baby honey child, I've loved you so long
But you deserve much better than me.""
So I'm just burnin' all around all the miles in the road

And I'm never goin' back and I'm never goin' home

I've been gone too long, I've been less right than wrong

I lost so much blood in the fallin' out



And I lit a fire that wouldn't go out

Until it consumed the walls and roof of this house

Until all I remember was burnin' away

And all I remember, you burned it away



See, for ten long years I've been hustlin' around

Tryin' to wash the sins and the sweat from my brow

Just tryin' to find a better life for me and my own

Just some rest for these tired workin' fingers



But nobody never gonna tell you the way

You gotta figure it out boys and suffer the rain

And the fools in the night and the heat of the day

When all you ever really wanted was for someone to understand



And I lit a fire that wouldn't go out

Until it consumed the walls and roof of this house

Until all I remember was burnin' away

And all I remember, you burned it away



Well, don't you take it so hard and baby, don't you cry

You cross your hard heart and you hope to die

Don't you tell me no more lies, you lied all the time

Don't you tell me no more lies, you lied every night



And you're sugar and spice and everything nice

You got Monroe hips, your poisoned lips and knives

And you're sugar and spice and everything nice

You got open wounds in a young boy's pride



And you're sugar and spice and everything nice

You got Monroe hips, your poisoned lips and knives

Sugar and spice, everything nice

I am the breath you can hear among the leaves of the trees
My sap emerges from the deep lakes flowing into the rivers and into the immense oceans
My blood, hot and violent, cleaves the grounding a blazing trail left by a fire dragon
Dark and deep is my womb where I generate any form of life
Here, the ancient learned to receive the old supreme art

I have created sprites and guardians, fools and sages to defend my original power

Hidden in a language written on stone shapes and symbols

Many where the children who worshipped my thousand faces with honour and respect

And I, good and terrible, fed them at my sacred springs with water and dragon's flash

Now I'm dying and so are all my faithful servants that men called Gods of Pagos

Now, the power of the only god hangs over me

And worse my fate will be if they forget about me

And with me the most ancient legend carried on by purest emotions will end

Follow the ancient path and don't turn to the false light

Raise your arms to heaven and you'll be protected

Let the spirit walk with your body and draw the cross in the circle

Abandon the sufferings that belong to your false nature

Love me and I will love you

Hate me and I will devour you

Descent into my crypts where the darkness of life reigns

And nourish the eternal sacred flame

Defend your brother tree and your sister stone because their lives are mine

Follow the snakes' trail

Because it will lead to me",Rock

We'd be so sad if you told us goodbye

And we promise not to shoot you out of the sky



It was a beautiful day

The kind you want to toast

We were treetop flyin'

Movin' west along the coast

Then we landed in the water

Just about my favorite thrill

When some asshole started firin'

When we taxied to Negril



Just about to lose my temper

As I endeavored to explain

We had only come for chicken

We were not a ganja plane

Well you should have seen there faces

When they finally realized

We were not some coked up cowboys

Sportin' guns and alibis

Don't you know we made a big mistaica

And we promise not to shoot you out of the sky



They shot from the lighthouse

They shot from the highway

They shot from the top of the cliff

They'd all gone haywire

We're catchin' fire

And there wasn't even a spliff



Well the word got out

All over the island

Friends, strangers, they were all apologizin'

Some thought me crazy for bein' way to nice

But it's just another shitty day in paradise

Knowing only pleasure

""on a little"" life I'm livin in a universe with no beginning to it

So it ain't an ending and at times I get to diggin into infinite subliminably spirited

A nigga with a ""clip and send it rip __ __ __""

Indigenous stork has just touched ground

Rappers organizations get shut down

Not that I don't wanna see my brothers succeed

But rap its like a sport, I dominate, so follow my lead

I be the G-I-F-T test me hefty left's be gettin' swung

Cruise like a jet ski

Up in yo apartment and plop on your couch y'all

Undisputed heavyweight lyrical southpaw



[Chorus]



It's like a lime to a lemon-that rhymes, I assemble them

At times when I'm ""__"" they shine you remember

""__"" divine forces ""__"" that refine men & women &

I rhyme for a livin', not just for the ""__ __""

That isn't what it's all about, really now, valid clout

Uzi mc's I have arguments n' fallin' outs wit'

About what it's all about, ain't about foamin out the mouth

Like a walkin tall can of Guinness Stout

""__ __ __""

When the battle cries soundin'

Ding-ding, hit 'em like, bing-bing

Eat 'em like, B-King, yet wit' no seasoning-bee sting

Wich yo girl dressed in a g-string she's swingin'

My way shorty and it sure looks good

I'm cookin up a batch of dopeness like a good cook should

I be the jack of trades, rappers pray

That I don't decapitate, after they cash his ass

Is that an irate? Great!

Grade-A, top-choice lyricism

Hey, hit me wit' that shell shocked rhythm

One time fo' the funky rhymes I say

Two times for the beat and for my DJ

It don't stop



[Chorus]



I say we drop it on a (one), we drop it on a (two)

We comin' out (fresh), and we do it (for you)

You know the deal with Blackalicious, we don't play

(from New York, NY) (to streets of LA) to (??)

You know we leave the party wreakin' a disaster

For the new ""millie"", rain like a shower

Let it seep in your pores (??)

Oh lord that's [scratch]

Rock ya from the top and to the bottom (from the bottom to the top)

(cause I grab the mic) wit the intent to get ill

A natural that you know who is (still Mrs. Field's)

So slide to the side and (take it light) and (??) all night (party people in the place...)

I make 'em suffer, to the fallen mc's I'd be the (quicker pickem upper) (galactic of a nebula)

I'm rappin the spectacular, attackin whack amateurs n' back stabbin salamanders

Creepin while I'm peepin on 'em (party time)

Before I used to hit the meetings it was (Thunderbird wine) (used to drink the Ole)

Now I drink Calistoga, sober and I'm older

But the world is still gettin colder (colder)

The Gift of Gab don't stop (the way I feel I have just got to rock)

So much stronger when the sun rises

So don't find your fear alarming

Your pain will disappear like nightfall

Wash it away

The remains of a battered soul

Trouble won't' last always

Believe me there'll be brighter days

Every single time you tried

about the hate i've ever seen

flicker on a screen, unsure of what it means

something inside is dying outside

make it to the end and never try to befriend



i wake up in a desert land, i hold my head down deep

with all my inner sufferings i'll never fall asleep

this heart of mine, tortured in dreams,

too much to stay awake

the scars of fate, i lost my faith

its more than i can take



you struggle just to stay alive

but only the strongest will survive

your fate will meet you everywhere",Rock

"Living in a daze, beyond belief
Withdrawn from all that I know
Disturbed by darkened thoughts
Of haunting agony, restrain the memorie
Fearing for my life
The government denies their sole existence

But it's much too late for them

Can't wait to see their faces

When they arrive again

Mental impairment, sanity lost, it's vanished away

But all I know, the men in black

Are secret spies, as the tension grows

Deep down inside, I know they're coming for me

For the 2nd time, I'm going, going away

Why am I caught in this conspiracy

Have to find a way

Don't care what it takes

I shall persevere

Tell me why it is this way

One more cosmic watergate

Can't believe it's me, strange captivity

Confused in this maze, no chance to escape

As the end draws near

New technology, high-tech slavery

Horrid state control, truth is far behind

Face the end of time

Tell me why it is this way

One more cosmic watergate

Psychic war, deletion zone

Future destiny unknown",Metal

Water kisses fill my mouth

Water fills my soul

"What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?
I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet

I was deceived by the wrapping



Got caught in your web

And I learned how to bleed

I was prey in your bed

And devoured completely



And it hurts my soul

Cause I can't let go

All these walls are caving in

I can't stop my suffering

I hate to show that I've lost control

Cause I, I keep going right back

To the one thing that I need to walk away from



I need to get away from ya

I need to walk away from ya

Get away, walk away, walk away



I should have known

I was used for amusement

Couldn't see through the smoke

It was all an illusion



Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)

But the venom seeps deeper(deeper, deeper)

We both can seduce

but darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)



I'm about to break

I can't stop this ache

I'm addicted to your allure

and I'm fiendin' for a cure

Every step I take

Leads to one mistake

I keep going right back

To the one thing that I need...



I can't mend

This torn state I'm in

Getting nothing in return

What did I do to deserve

The pain of this slow burn

And everywhere I turn

I keep going right back

To the one thing that I need to walk away from



I need to get away from ya

I need to walk away from ya



Everytime I try to grasp for air

I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over

Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,

I let out a silent prayer

let it be over, over



Inside I'm screaming

Begging, pleading

No more



I don't know what to do

My heart has been bruised

So sad but it's true

Each beat reminds me of you



It hurts my soul

Cause I can't let go

All these walls are caving in

I can't stop my suffering

I hate to show that I've lost control

Cause I

I keep going right back

To the one thing that I need, Oh



I'm about to break

And I can't stop this ache

I'm addicted to your allure

And I'm fiendin' for a cure

Every step I take

Leads to one mistake

I keep going right back

To the one thing that I need, Oh



I can't mend

This torn state I'm in

Getting nothing in return

What did I do to deserve

The pain of this moment

And everywhere I turn

I keep going right back

To the one thing that I need to walk away from



I say...

I need to get away from ya

I need to walk away from ya

Get away, walk away, walk away



Only thing I need to do is walk away



I need to get away from ya

I need to walk away from ya

Get away, walk away, walk away



I need to get away from ya

I need to walk away from ya

Get away, walk away, walk away



I need to get away from ya

I need to walk away from ya

Get away, walk away, walk away

brings a blackened sky to fall

Full moon glow
Steals the light
When headless horsemen ride
In the distance hellhounds cry

And banshee wails arise

Turn your fear into fantasy

Concealing all the pain

You the victim of perfection

The dark side gets its way

The dark side gets its way



Ain't no use singing the blues

Ain't to one finding no clues

And you can't walk away

No stopping, no escape



[Chorus:]

Tired eyes you cannot fight

The body snatcher comes tonight

Wired mind embraced the sight

The body snatcher comes tonight



Creeping shadows cross the walls

What are they trying to say?

Lucy Love died in this place

I've come to take you away

Turn the spirit when you sleep

And leave an empty space

I'm the demon of destruction

The gods have now been swayed

The gods have now been swayed



Ain't no use singing the blues

Ain't no one finding no clues

And you can't walk away

No stopping, no escape

Well you cannot run you cannot hide

'Cos evil has its dark design

You cannot run you cannot hide

'Cos evil has its dark design



I have reason to believe

There's power in the signs

Look she turns ghostly grey

The dark one has arrived

Well you cannot run you cannot hide

'Cos evil has its dark design



The body snatcher comes tonight

Yeah yeah yeah



Yeah you cannot run you cannot hide



Cos evil has its dark design



The body snatcher comes tonight

That doesn't work for everyone.
But I'm thinking this could be a one,
If we put our minds to it.

So I had so much to say;

And I know you hate seeing me this way,

But I'm having fun.

It's real life, it's real life.

You realise, you realise;

It's real life, it's real life. (x2)

And losing track of the time.

Even when the Summer's passing by.



And bringing it down to focus;

And try to bring it down but I'm hopeless;

Andwe should write this down, so we can remember it.



And yes there was a time

When we were two of a kind,

but now I can't even remember why.



You realise, you realise;

It's real life, it's real life.

You realise, you realise;

It's real life, it's real life.



Trying to prove you're alright;

And losing track of the time.

Sixteen is on the side.

Don't waste anytime inside.

So my advise and only run a mile



And have another drink

And then think this one over

You'll dig yourself a grave, everyday, when you're sober

You see, what I mean, at your best interest your all over...me

I could never be what you need.



Finders keepers

No you don't keep me in line

I like secrets 

Cause they keep me in line

Oh habits die hard

But I'm too young to die



Finders keepers

The whole thing is a lie 

You won't find her

Cause she's too hard to find

So my advise and only run a mile

And I bet, you guess, me right

(you guess me, yes, you guessed me right)

I bet you guess me right.",Rock

A dark light's entering the church
By pale glass windows


and I feel so cold







I can't stop looking at the wooden box placed



In the very centre of the nave



I'm trying to imagine you...



...sleeping







We're in the home



Of life and death



Where each being takes end



And time flows with the sand!







We cry as one



Your friends, your family



Death has stained this day



And now he's gone away







I think you would be smiling



Listening to this priest today



Before his church



I can still remember



Your songs about Christendom and stovery







I can't realise!



Death before my eyes!



Listening to this sermon's lies!







He's never seen you!



He's never talked to you!



How can his white lies be true?







But I have to understand



This prayer that pays tribute too



It's not here to be true, but help us go through



The deep pain that we bear, the way we all suffer



Our dreams of paradise get the pain out of our minds.

Everyone that knew him knew which side that he'd be on

"Sweet Marie you mean a lot to me
In my memory I hold you very dearly
Once in all my dreams, my plans, hopes and future schemes
There was sweet Marie
But my home is where my heart is

And my heart is not at home

Whenever we are parted

I feel so all alone



With twilight falling

The moon is calling sweet Marie

What the sea tells only sea shells

Are whispering sweet Marie



Into the darkness goes this message sweet Marie

Some lovers are sometimes parted

They must end what they have started

All that's left is the broken hearted, I must depart my sweet Marie



Somewhere out in Arizona

Such a long way from California

I felt so alone there

I was two thousand miles away from home there



Tonight we're going to play Boston

I still don't know what the hell is going on

Oh but I wrote this song

To keep me thinking on about my sweet Marie



Sweet Marie you mean a lot to me

This melody it keeps haunting me

My sweet Marie

In harmony, it's will me constantly, sweet Marie

My heart it's not at home

The beast of hell is here
He's come to rule the Earth
They will obey his power
A serpent Rises

Rise abive the Earth

Followed by an army

An army of the immortal



An army of the dead



Secretly they can arrive

The enemy is fire

Ripped from their sight

Falling through the sky

The enemy immortal



Never die



Here is wisdom and faith

No one stand and beg for

The number of the beast released

A number of a man is his number

Six hundred and sixty six, 666



He's risen from the sea

The beast of hell is here

Come to rule the world

And you will be in fire



Surtur is risen, Surtur is here

Repent youtself, he'll rule the world

Surtur is risen, Surtur is here

Repent yourself, he'll rule the world

Rule the world!

Repent youtself, he'll rule the world

"Love to me was to be something more when it came to you
Forever filling a void
Something I cannot avoid
Every time I'm put together I'm being destroyed
So when you come around

You'll find me on the ground

Searching for a piece that I've never found



I feel so stupid, friends knew it, turned to it



I'm by...myself, I'm bound...to be



I can't find what I'm missing

I've lost myself I hope that you're listening

I've seen my puzzle taken apart

It's hard to start again



But with you, all I knew was the filth that you put me through



I'm sick reliving the past

My time it came and it passed

I'm holding on to the memories, making them last

So when you come around

You'll find me on the ground

Searching for a piece that I've never found



And I knew it was to be

My words are quick to undress me

Filled my heart with broken glass

To make this thing last

Feels so numb when we lie together

Feels so numb when we lie together



I'm by...myself, I'm bound...to be",Rock

"How here's a little story - I've got to tell
About three bad brothers - you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock, M.C.A., and me - Mike D.
Been had a little horsy named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer

Riding across the land - kicking up sand

Sheriff's posse on my tail cause I'm in demand

One lonely Beastie I be

All by myself - without nobody

The sun is beating down on my baseball hat

The air is gettin' hot - the beer is getting flat

Lookin' for a girl - I ran into a guy

His name is M.C.A., I said, ""Howdy"" - he said, ""Hi""



He told a little story - that sounded well rehearsed

Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst

The brew was in my hand - and he was on my tip

His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry - he asked me for a sip

He said, ""Can I get some?""

I said, ""You can't get none!""

Had a chance to run

He pulled out his shotgun

He was quick on the draw - I thought I'd be dead

He put the gun to my head and this is what he said,



""Now my name is M.C.A. - I've got a license to kill

I think you know what time it is - it's time to get ill

Now what do we have here - an outlaw and his beer

I run this land, you understand - I make myself clear.""

We stepped into the wind - he had a gun, I had a grin

You think this story's over but it's ready to begin



""Now I got the gun - you got the brew

You got two choices of what you can do

It's not a tough decision as you can see

I can blow you away or you can ride with me"" I said, I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border

The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter

I did it like this - I did it like that

I did it with a whiffleball bat

So I'm on the run - the cop's got my gun

And right about now - it's time to have some fun

The King Adrock - that is my name

And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.""

We rode for six hours the we hit the spot

The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot

This dude was staring like he knows who we are

We took the empty spot next to him at the bar

M.C.A. said, ""Yo, you know this kid?""

I said, ""I didn't."" - but I know he did

The kid said, ""Get ready cause this ain't funny

My name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money.""

Pulled out the jammy - aimed it at the sky

He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" - and let two fly

Hands went up and people hit the floor

He wasted two kids that ran for the door

""I'm Mike D. and I get respect

Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect""

M.C.A. was with it and he's my ace

So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face

The piano player's out - the music stopped

His boy had beef - and he got dropped

Mike D. grabbed the money - M.C.A. snatched the gold

I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold",Rock

But for now, I just pretend.

If anyone can make me fall in love,

You can.

"I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct

Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect

Got the right to vote and will elect

And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect



They called us and said we're gettin iller

There's no one chiller

It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller

As one def rapper, I know I can hang

I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang

Roll to the rock, rock to the roll

DMC stands for devestating mic control

You can't touch me with a ten foot pole

And I even made the devil sell me his soul



Now we crash through walls, cut through floors

Bust through ceilings and knock down doors

And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box

You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks

For every living person we're a purple treat

It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?



Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool

I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule

It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool

It's all brand new, never ever old school



You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend

When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend

Music ain't nothin but a people's jam

It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band



Now I walked on ice and never fell

I spent my time in a plush hotel

I stood on many stages, held many mics

Take airplane flights, at huge heights

So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please

Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds

Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees

Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC



I am from, around the way

And Run goes to school, every day

And Jay plays the records he has to play

And we get down with no delay, HEY!

I rock the party with the words I speak

And Run says the rhymes that are unique

And Jay cuts the records every day of the week

And we are the crew that can never be beat

So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend

Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end

The rhymes we say, shall set a trend

Because a devestating rap is what we send



Every jam we play, we break two needles

There's three of us but we're not the Beatles

My name is Darryl, you can call him D

You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC

People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""

D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean



Like we said before, we rock hardcore

I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw

And now we got the knack, to attract

Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac

We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot

When it comes to rock, give it all we got

To be MC's, we got what it takes

Let the poppers pop and the breakers break

We're cool cool cats, it's like that

That's the way it is, so stay the hell back

We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's

Cause they don't make no songs like these

PERIOD!",Rap

Leyenda que contaba chulo viejo de barrio en barrio

Boca a Boca, en la calzada

A los oídos del curioso rellenaba



Ah había una vez, una pareja desprovista poca vista sin dinero

Pensando atónito, tónico, crónico como vivir

Salir del negro fango que le ahogaba

Tramaban, andaban, entre besos una cámara silente

Para un estúpido tupido cliente

Que de vivo mira el punto de las daba

Estaba, andaba vigilando a la criolla de carnada

Era más bruta que una mula lomo arriba



Vengo yo de tal manera



Que que que esta historia echa candela

Te la voy a hacer bien breve

Para que no te me aceleres

Oíste asere, todo lo que ella pedía

el punto la complacía y escucha lo que le decía



Todo lo que le pedía

El punto se la gastaba

Oh, una linda habitación en el Cohiba

El punto se la gastaba

Hay un vestido para ella,

Hay un vestido para ella,

Una camisa pa' mi

El punto se la gastaba

Like it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guy

It's not like you would lose some critical piece

If somehow you moved point A to point B

Maintaining there is no point changing 'cause

Now I could talk to you till I'm blue in the face

But we still would arrive at the very same place

With you running around and me out of the race

Something older than time and hope you could make

It better, that would be a mistake

So take it just so far

Acting steady always ready to defend your fears

"Oslo in the summertime nobody can fall asleep
I'm staring out the window from my bed
At 4 a.m. the sun is up
look the sky is pepppered with sea birds and with crows all cackeling
HVA?

Up in tre ten Heimdalsgate

me and Nina making fun of footballers in Rudolph Neilson Plass

I practice my norwegian on poor beffudeled waitresses

who shake their heads completely at a loss

Oslo in the summertime the streets are strangely quite 'cause

everyone's away on holiday

HVA?



Oslo in the summertime Pakistani children play locked inside of the courtyard all day

Pretty people everywhere sun lamp tans and flaxen hair

Just tell the American not to stare

Free your inner soul and break away from tradition

"At first I was afraid, I was petrified,
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side,
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong,
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along,
And so your back, from outerspace,

I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face,

I should've changed that stupid lock,

I should've made you leave your key,

If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me,



Go on now go, walk out the door,

Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore,

Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye,

You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I, I will survive,

Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,

I've got all my life to live; I've got all my love to give,

And I'll survive, I will survive,

And trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,

And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself,

I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high,

And you'll see me, somebody new,

I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,

And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free,

Now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me.

"I want to kill, to throw against the wall
Hole in the glass to feel it all
A release to stay insane
I want to scream
Clenched fist, ground teeth

A bad dream, feeling so mean

Stumble across my piece

Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel

All of the sudden it feels so real

The bang, the smoke, the blood



Jump to the car, start it to the floor and while the engine's still in a 

roar slap it it drive

And leave behind a trail of anger a path to find



I want to scream

Clenched fist, ground teeth

A bad dream, feeling so mean

Stumble across my piece

Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel

All of the sudden it feels so real

The bang, the smoke, the blood



I can't feel my feet but I see em flyin

Never hit the ground, rising above

Looking down on you, down on the heads of the damned

Marching all right through into the crowd



I want to scream

Clenched fist, ground teeth

A bad dream, feeling so mean

Stumble across my piece

Quiver the index, sweat between the skin and the steel

All of the sudden it feels so real

The bang, the smoke, the blood



I want to kill, to throw against the wall

Hole in the glass to feel it all

A release to stay insane

To make love last night

Where do we go from here my love

What are we doing baby

Boy you gotta let me know

Why can't we live the way we want

I want the world to know

I just gotta let it show

What do we stand to lose

If being together

Is what we choose

Oh my love

About us



Could this be a crazy dream

And if so then you're dreaming too

Could it be that we could be wrong

Even though we're feeling so right

That I want you tonight

And I know you want me too

When there's nothing left to say

Show a little faith now

When you're dealing with the truth

It should be a state of mind

Or another point of view

I can promise it won't break

And the questions never end

You gotta let it go

But in the end I say that I don't know

And do you believe in miracles?

I hear they happen every day

And if you believe in them

We can walk on water

It's a temporary breakdown

When there's nothing left to say

What you find

Will remain or pass us by

Some will climb

Some will fall

Some will rise above it all



Promises you make or break

Gone tomorrow, here today

Let it pass

Let it wait

Turn around and walk away



When nothings making sense

And the questions never end

You gotta let it go

Every now and then

I can't pretend

But in the end I say that I don't know

And do you believe in miracles?

I hear they happen every day

Sitting beside me was a man with no hair
From the look on his face and the size of his toes
He comes from a place that nobody knows
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating

Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky

Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating

If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why



I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee

He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie

He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky

He says they'll come get him, come get him some day



He says where he's from is called Albertane

There they use more than 10% of the brain

But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave

They run around in underwear and they never shave



Or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating

Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky

Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating

If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

The man sitting by me who was barely dressed

Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane

And left me at the bus stop just barely sane



I've been sitting here too long thinkin' about Milwaukee

I've been talking too long on my yellow walkie talkie

I'm talking to Mars you may think I'm wacky

"You came to my show
And I saw you in the crowd
I didn't know your name
I didn't know your name
I asked all my friends who you were

And your story

They told me the same

They told me the same



I left my heart to you but it's not fair

'Cause you're taking me for granted baby

I made a stone with you but it's not fair

'Cause you're over me and land it baby



One journey for you but it's worth it

One life and with me and it's magic

One journey for you but it's worth it

One life and with me and it's magic



You stayed at my head

While I saw you all the time

I didn't think you care

I didn't think you care



I fought you all day

With a mouth full of attitude

You stole my away

You stole my away



I left my heart to you but it's not fair

'Cause you're taking me for granted baby

I made a stone with you but it's not fair

'Cause you're over me and land it baby



One journey for you but it's worth it

One life and with me and it's magic

One journey for you but it's worth it

One life and with me and it's magic



'Cause you're over me and land it baby

'Cause you're taking me for granted baby

'Cause you're over me and land it baby



One journey for you but it's worth it

One life and with me and it's magic

One journey for you but it's worth it

One journey for you but it's worth it

"An only child alone and wild
A cab'net maker's son
His hands were meant for diff'rent work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home
And went his lone and solitary way

And he gave to me a gift I know

I never can repay



A quiet man of music

Denied a simpler fate

He tried to be a soldier once

But his music wouldn't wait

He earned his love thru' discipline

A thund'ring velvet hand

His gentle means of sculpting souls

Took me years to understand



The leader of the band is tired

And his eyes are growing old

But his blood runs thru' my instrument

And his song is in my soul

My life has been a poor attempt

To imitate the man

I'm just a living legacy

To the leader of the band



My brother's lives were diff'rent

For they heard another call

One went to Chicago

And the other to St Paul

And I'm in Colorado

When I'm not in some hotel

Living out this life I've chose

And come to know so well

And your stories of the road

I thank you for the freedom

I thank you for the kindness

And the times when you got tough

Where do we go from here

What do I do with these feelings

Longing to have you near

Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

Why can't these memories just be erased

Why must I yearn for your kiss

Reminds me how much your missed

Longing to have you near

Knowing we shouldn't be dealing

When it's time for us to go our separate ways

When this night is done, I be wanting to hold onto you

Ooooh the sun, I wish we could push it all away

From our childhood days
And we made our plans,
And we had to go our seperate ways.

You pursued an education.

Can you find release,

And will you ever change

Will you ever write your masterpiece.

Are you still in school

Living up to expectations...James...



You were so relied upon, everybody knows how hard you tried-

Hey...just look at what a job you've done,

Carrying the weight of family pride.

James...you've been well behaved,

You've been working so hard

But will you always stay

Someone else's dream of who you are.

Do what's good for you, or you're not good for anybody...James.

You pursued an education...James...

How you gonna know for sure-everything was so well organized.

Hey...now everything is so secure,

and everybody else is satisfied.

And will you ever change,

When will you write your masterpiece.

"The breath of the morning I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
Up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home

Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits

Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets



They're all uptight, uptight

Uptight, uptight

Uptight, uptight



I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane

Late at night when I'm driving

Take me on board their beautiful ship

Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me

They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely

I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life

They'd shut me away but I'd be all right

All right, all right, all right

Its callin stars by name

A lonely song of freedom rings

In hope of someone listening and

So I send my feeble flare

Through the silent arctic air

Heading anywhere

Until at last i've finally found

A place to lay my anchor down

To the one that was waiting for me

Carried the weight on my own

And I visualized 

The love that came to be

The answer that heaven has 

Sent down to me

"You're on the breeze
You rest in grey
Eternally sleep
Erase the day
I couldn't see her
Through all the rain

And her sigh

Holding our breath to the end



We end up far away

Out on the breeze

Take me past the horizon

We're running out of time



Anywhere is nowhere

Everywhere is fear

And you just

All the walls of my gloomy house?

It's like awaiting

The end of the world

Here in this days?

The end of the world



There is no answer

To all that is crying

When all those die

To carry on forever

"Find me only in dreams
Thumbing my stitches and seams 
With patchwork skin and quilted smile
I breathe recycled air and sleep on borrowed time.
My foot prints are heaven bound

Through snow and ice and shattered sound

Hide me in that smile you wear

In those dreaming eyes...

In the tangles of your hair

I'll still be yours when all this is through

"[Music T. Gustafsson, Lyrics E. Rundqvist]
Screams surround everything, anxiety-ridden fear
Hundred piled corpses
Mixed with those alive, a rotten mess
Penetrated by death



In sludge of body parts crawl those who still breathe

Cold dead corpses

Crushed beneath still screaming bodies

Bowels gushed from wounds



Stream into pools of blood

Floats into a sea of death



Dead or buried alive

The skin burst underground

Suffocated by a hundred corpses

Broken bodies decompose



Stream into pools of blood

Floats into a sea of death",Rock

I'm not how you'd have hoped I'd be
For what you're reaching out to me
I've got to break this scene goodbye
Yeah man I'm doin fine

I fucked my chick and did a line

Why do you still waste my time

Who gives a fuck just what you think



Somebody showed me there's a little thing to take me there

My mother warned me about this little thing, but I dont care



Mind your life, I'll do the same

Go back from where in which you came

You want to try to push your weight

Expect a fist right in the face

All your lies and social crimes

And circumstances you deny

Give your piss a special prize

And see them try to blow me away



Somebody shomes me there's a little thing to take me there

My mother warned me about this little thing, but I dont care",Rock

Oh baby when you talk like that

You make a woman go mad

So be wise and keep on

Reading the signs of my body



And I'm on tonight

You know my hips don't lie

And I'm starting to feel it's right

All the attraction, the tension

Don't you see baby, this is perfection



Hey Girl, I can see your body moving

And it's driving me crazy

And I didn't have the slightest idea

Until I saw you dancing



And when you walk up on the dance floor

Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl

And everything so unexpected - the way you right and left it

So you can keep on shaking it



I never really knew that she could dance like this

She makes a man want to speak Spanish

Oh boy, I can see your body moving

Half animal, half man

I don't, don't really know what I'm doing

But you seem to have a plan

My will and self restraint

Have come to fail now, fail now

See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know

That's a bit too hard to explain



Baila en la calle de noche

Baila en la calle de día

I need a whole club dizzy

Why the CIA wanna watch us?

Colombians and Haitians

I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction

No more do we snatch ropes

Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats



I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie

Lying on my back, wheeled under blinding light
Shackled restraints resist my attempted fight

They said it was for science

But I'm the human guinea pig

The nightmare continues, I see through their lies

"You and your smile hold a strange invitation
Somehow it seems
We've shed our dream but we're
Time after time in a room full of strangers
Out of the blue, suddenly you were there


Wherever I go you're the glow of temptation,

Glancing my way in the grey of the dawn

And always your smile holds that strange invitation

Then you are gone

Where oh where have you gone



How long must I live in a world of illusion

Be where you are so near yet so far, apart

Hoping you'll say with a sweet invitation

Where have you been, darling come in

Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children

The last generation

We are the ones they left behind

And I wonder when we are ever gonna change

Living under the fear, till nothing else remains



We don't need another hero

We don't need to know the way home

All we want is life beyond

Thunderdome



Looking for something

We can rely on

There's gotta be something better out there

Love and compassion

Their day is coming

All else are castles built in the air

And I wonder when we are ever gonna change

Living under the fear till nothing else remains



All the children say

We don't need another hero

We don't need to know the way home

All we want is life beyond

Thunderdome



So what do we do with our lives

We leave only a mark

Will our story shine like a light

Or end in the dark

Give it all or nothing



We don't need another hero

We don't need to know the way home

All we want is life beyond

"Revenge, smarter than the radio,
Better than the gossips taken from your mouth.

Revenge, looking for some better shit.

Looking for a thumb tack for your back.



[Chorus]

You're living like a jerk, living like a jerk.

Saying one thing just to prove another.

Revenge, instant satisfaction,

Sweet success for the working class.



Revenge, working like a dynamo.

Better than the gossips taken from your mouth.

Revenge, looking for some better

Looking for a thumb tack for your back.

"When I find out who I am 
I am going to know just what to do
When I pull myself together again

Is this forever this feeling I got

Not enough and too much

So free and so caught up

And something aint nothing about the same time

I'm either out of my head or I'm out of my mind



When I find out who I am 

I'm going to know just what to do

When I pull myself together again

I'm going to give myself to you



Is this forever this feeling that I'm not 

Moving at all but I just can't stop it

It's like I'm dreaming and I'm wide awake too

Will you remember me cause I won't forget you



When I find out who I am 

I'm going to know just what to do

When I pull myself together again

I'm going to give myself to you



I guess I was saving my life for latter

Or maybe I should have been giving myself to you

Now I hope that I got to find out who I am before I do

Before I do



When I find out who I am 

I'm going to know just what to do

When I pull myself together again

I'm going to give myself to you

When I find out who I am 

I'm going to know just what to do

When I pull myself together again I know

I'm going to give myself to you

I'm going to give myself to you

Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fuck it 
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..



I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag

of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be

the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth

And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works

And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve

all this tension dispensin these sentences

Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest

and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..

but at least have the decency in you

to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out 

in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter

to not come and speak to me (speak to me)..

I don't know you and no, 

I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing

I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think

I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..

No patience is in me and if you offend me 

I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air 

I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit

I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe

I'm tired of all you (of all you)..

I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me



Chorus: Eminem



And I am, whatever you say I am

If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

In the paper, the news everyday I am

Radio won't even play my jam

Cause I am, whatever you say I am

If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

In the paper, the news everyday I am

I don't know it's just the way I am



[Eminem]

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered

with all of this nonsense it's constant

And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content -

- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""

And all of this controversy circles me

and it seems like the media immediately

points a finger at me (finger at me)..

So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie

or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up

when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up

with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too

When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school

and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin

Where were the parents at? And look where it's at

Middle America, now it's a tragedy

Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty

havin this happenin (this happenin)..

then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way)..

But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire 

to burn and it's burnin and I have returned



Chorus



[Eminem]

I'm so sick and tired of bein admired

that I wish that I would just die or get fired

and dropped from my label and stop with the fables

I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is..""

And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation

to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations

And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..

to deal with these cocky caucasians who think

I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk 

with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin 

the same fuckin questions (fuckin questions)..

What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in

The why, the who what when, the where, and the how

'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out

cause they drivin me crazy (drivin me crazy).. I can't take it 

I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for ev-ery fan that I get

But I can't take a SHIT, in the bathroom

without someone standin by it

No I won't sign your autograph

You can call me an asshole I'm glad

This isn't slowing down.
We've hit black ice and lost control.
We're spinning faster now.
Tell me are we flying? Are we falling to the ground?
If tomorrow doesn't come, did we die for nothing?



Recounting past events has helped reveal that you don't give a damn 

about the days when you would live the words you wrote.

Not the person who you were; I hate the person you've become.

You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing.



Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.

A person I will not become.

A jaded liar, unforgivable.



Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.

May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.



You said you started up this home 

because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run.

You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.

If you had then where were you?

We've payed our dues without you.



Am I the only one who sees all of the deceit and festering hypocrisy?

Don't ever talk to me like you think you know me or what I've been through.

I am nothing like you!



Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.

A person I will not become.

This is the last time you will have us.

You're lawless and purely dishonest.

A scandal that we have funded for you.

Make no mistake this all is about you.



No, we never knew.

Don't buy what they sell you.

(You're lawless and purely dishonest.)

No, we never knew.

(A scandal that we have funded for you.)

Don't buy what they sell you.

(Make no mistake this all is about you.)



But I can't stop feeling love for this place we both came from. 

I will never lose my youth.

All of this is too unforgettable.



Some stop feeling love.

Some stop feeling love.

Some stop feeling love.

Some stop feeling love.

Some stop feeling love.

Some stop feeling love.

Some stop feeling...



Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.

Awake, angels of lunacy,

Incinerate yourselves,
In the blaze of Babylon,

We invoke the Eidolon.



Unleash the storm...



We renounce the sin,

Of mortal fallacy,

Bestow upon us,

Our stellar legacy.



Peel the benighted shells,

From our radiant cores,

We obey the laws,

Of finitude no more.



Ascend...

In Akasha to Procreate.

Strip the flesh from your soul,

Extend...

Open the Silver Gate...

Melt yourself beyond all control.



Give birth to the vision,

Let enter the voice,

And dare not falter,

Lest the demons eat you.

Confide in your Nuit,

Never your senses.



Nine apparitions,

The nails of Yod,

Drip from the moon

As unhallowed blood,

Anubis' terror to feed you,

As the night condenses.



Ascend...

In Akasha to Procreate.

Strip the flesh from your soul,

Extend...

Open the Silver Gate...

Melt yourself beyond all control.



In poisoned aberration,

Tarnished minion abide,

Convocating execrations,

To drown and smother, to divide.



Recline, Rejoice,

Discard the body,

And savour this, your threnody,

Divine by lust alone,

And second skin,

As the eyes turn to stone,

Let the heave begin!



Azazel!

Shemhazai!

Rejoin your kin in faith and fate!



Heed not the warnings,

We invoke the manyfold

Ny-Ar-Rut-Hotep

For we know,

There is no peace at the gate,

There is no peace at the gate...



Ascend,

In Akasha to procreate,

Strip the flesh from your soul,

Extend, open the Silver Gate,

Melt yourself beyond all control,

In Akasha to procreate,

Disembodied, unfettered souls,

Open the Silver Gate,

We embrace the stars

Would you stop crying or

Would you open your eyes

And it all had to end

What about family

What about all that

"When Amanitas came
He could not abstain
And he took a juicy bite
He found that he could see
The forest beyond the trees
And she squeezed his head real tight

He knew he'd changed his luck

Paid a buck for corn and cluck

But something just wasn't right

Somethin' didn't feel quite right



I can feel your poison



When Amanitas came

It left his brain

Feelin' a tad bit sour

When the pompous ones arrived

He was barely alive

She'd sucked him dry of all his power

Now if you're feeling bold 

Dont say that you've not been told

She'll know the ivory off your tower

Then she'll glower



I can feel your poison



Now with your trousers full of spores

You get down on all fours

To search the ground like hungry oxen

Cause to fearless fungus friends

Your kinship has no end

Till they pump you full of toxin",Rock

Tied with a ribbon
Some people won't sail the sea 'cause they're safer on land
To follow what's written
But I'd follow you to the great unknown
Off to a world we call our own

And we promised to never let go

We're walking the tightrope

We can see the whole world down below

We're walking the tightrope

Never sure, never know how far we could fall

But it's all an adventure

That comes with a breathtaking view

Walking the tightrope

With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Mountains and valleys, and all that will come in between

Desert and ocean

You pulled me in and together we're lost in a dream

Always in motion

So I risk it all just to be with you

And I risk it all for this life we choose



Hand in my hand

And you promised to never let go

We're walking the tightrope

High in the sky

We can see the whole world down below

We're walking the tightrope

Never sure, will you catch me if I should fall?

Well, it's all an adventure

That comes with a breathtaking view

without letting go to too delicate dreams

"In New York freedom looks like
Too many choices
In New York I found a friend
To drown out the other voices


Voices on a cell phone

Voices from home

Voices of the hard sell

Voices down a stairwell

Just got a place in New York





In New York summers get hot

Well into the hundreds

You can walk around the block

Without a change of clothing





Hot as a hair dryer in your face

Hot as handbag and a can of mace

Forget how to sit still

Tell yourself you will stay in

But it's down to Alphaville

Feel like they own the place

They got the airport, city hall

Asphalt, asphalt

They even got the police

Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew

Happily not like me and you

That's where I lost you

In New York I lost it all

To you and your vices

Still I'm staying on to figure out

My midlife crisis





I hit an iceberg in my life

You know I'm still afloat

You lose your balance, lose your wife

In the queue for the lifeboat





You got to put the women and children first

But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York

When the sun has had its day

I heard your voice whispering

Come away now

Never did we want it more.

A sad and lonely boy,

Did not know how to get better,



Then heaven up above,

Sent me a super love,

And now I'm happy forever.

They say I'm just talking crazy,

If you'l allow me to,

Tell you 'bout my Super Lady



She's all that I could explore,

She's more than a dream,

She's my everthing

Be feeling half this good,

The world for me is new place,

Because our love's the best,

The wine for me has a new taste,



I'll let my lady know,

I'll never let her go,

Forever I'm gonna hold on,



She said she feel's the same,

Don't wanna play no game,

Just wants our love to live on and on,



Wish I could fly to the sky,

And write out her name,



Climb to the top of the world,

And loudly exclaim,

"(Feat. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson) 
I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade

The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five

But I am still alive.



I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide

And with the sea I did abide.

I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico

I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow

And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed

But I am living still.



I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide

Where steel and water did collide

A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado

I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below

They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound

But I am still around..I'll always be around..and around and around and

around and around



I fly a starship across the Universe divide

And when I reach the other side

I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can

Perhaps I may become a highwayman again

Or I may simply be a single drop of rain

But I will remain

And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",Country

follow my instincts, my star

on my sleeve i wear my heart

I'm counting all my blessings

and the gifts I have received

Still there's always someone

something to overcome

Took all my life to understand

that I am what I am, who I am

On fashion fingernails

Her lovers have her walking 'round

On instruments of torture

And lies in her splendour for a picture opportunity

Cover up that bruise, put on patent leather shoes

Hopelessly

The hope is we have so much to feel good about



Oh this has gotta be the good life

"There's a place in your heart 
And I know that it is love 
And this place could be much 
Brighter than tomorrow 
And if you really try 

You'll Find There's No Need 

To Cry 

In This Place You'll Feel 

There's No Hurt Or Sorrow 



There are ways 

To get there 

If you care enough 

For the living 

Make a little space 

Make a better place



Chorus: 

Heal the world 

Make it a better place 

For you and for me 

And the entire human race 

There are people dying 

If you care enough 

For the living 

Make a better place 

For you and for me 



If you want to know why 

There's a love that cannot lie 

Love is strong 

It only cares for joyful giving 



If we try 

We shall see 

In this bliss we cannot feel 

Fear or dread 

We stop existing and start living 



Then it feels that always 

Love's enough for us growing 

make a better world 

Make a better world



Chorus 



And the dream we were conceived in 

Will reveal a joyful face 

And the world we once believed in 

Will shine again in grace 



Then why do we keep strangling life 

Wound this earth 

Crucify it's soul 

Though it's plain to see 

This world is heavenly 

Be God's glow 



We could fly so high 

Let our spirits never die 

In my heart 

I feel you are all my brothers 



Create a world with no fear 

Together we'll cry happy tears 

See the nations turn their swords 

Into plowshares 



We could really get there 

If you cared enough for the living 

Make a little space 

To make a better place

There are people dying 

If you care enough for the living 

Make a better place

"All lost at sea
Chasing idle dreams
These philosophies
Were made up of things we had time to believe
But I'm trying to get

Glimpses of what comes next

What can we expect

To get for the time we've spent?



Down on our knees

Crying and begging but impossible to please

We just feed and feed

Gasping for air we really don't need



But I'm scared of what I'll become

Scared of what I have and haven't done

I'm still scared of falling into the sun

Scared the other ones will never come



'Cause I don't wanna live my life all alone

Always hoping for a chance that's already gone

It's all we'll do

It's all we'll do



Shaking in the wind

Why don't you just go back in?

You're always starving

Why don't you stop measuring?



But I'm scared of what I'll become

Scared of what I have and haven't done

I'm still scared of falling into the sun

Scared the other ones will never come



'Cause I don't wanna live my life all alone

Always hoping for a chance that's already gone

It's all we'll do

It's all we'll do

"If we turned our reactors to the sun,

The world would be reformed,
The legislation simply needs a push along.

We anticipate reactions to our points,

Before the guns are drawn,

That's preemption of our own.

We'll win their hearts by simply being more informed.

Watching towel girls go by

I'm stumped by your words

You laughed as one caught my eye (I've never been without my weaknesses).

Getting evildoers done,

Tony Danza's on the run,

He and Mona made the list as fall begun.



Then spring right into action, up at dawn,

We'll see that winning can be fun,

We cannot rid them of their guns,

It's through diplomacy that real change will come.



We're stuck in hotels,

Watching cards pass us by,

We've worn out the deck

I took your queen without trying (War can be a game, you see)



We're stuck in the West,

Watching cowgirls go by,

The night moseys in,

The Gallup's not on your mind.

But it's you that's got me stuck on this campaign.",Rock

"Windin' your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day
You'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold.

It's got so many people but it's got no soul

And it's taking you so long

To find out you were wrong

When you thought it had everything



You used to think that it was so easy

You used to say that it was so easy

But you're tryin'

You're tryin' now

Another year and then you'll be happy

Just one more year and then you'll be happy

But you're cryin'

You're cryin' now



Way down the street there's a lad in his place

He opens the door he's got that look on his face

And he asks you where you've been

You tell him who you've seen

And you talk about anything



He's got this dream about buyin' some land

He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands

And then he'll settle down there's a quiet little town

And forget about everything



But you know he'll always keep movin'

You know he's never gonna stop movin

Cus he's rollin'

He's the rollin' stone



And when you wake up it's a new mornin'

The sun is shinin' it's a new morning

You're goin'

His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away

I coming to see her real soon I hope

He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat



He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope

To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope

He stamped it and handed it to her to mail

Her big eyes were shining her little face pale



She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way

And when she stepped out never looked either way

A big auto hit her and sped away fast

The little girls prayers had been answered at last



The postman was passing and picked up the note

Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke

Straight up into heaven this letter did go

She's happy up there with her mommy I know",Country

"Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough

They never did like Mama's homemade dress

Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.

And I was standin' on the side of the road

Rain fallin' on my shoes

Heading out for the East Coast

Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,

Tangled up in blue.



She was married when we first met

Soon to be divorced

I helped her out of a jam, I guess,

But I used a little too much force.

We drove that car as far as we could

Abandoned it out West

Split up on a dark sad night

Both agreeing it was best.

She turned around to look at me

As I was walkin' away

I heard her say over my shoulder,

""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""

Tangled up in blue.



I had a job in the great north woods

Working as a cook for a spell

But I never did like it all that much

And one day the ax just fell.

So I drifted down to New Orleans

Where I happened to be employed

Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat

Right outside of Delacroix.

But all the while I was alone

The past was close behind,

I seen a lot of women

But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew

Tangled up in blue.



She was workin' in a topless place

And I stopped in for a beer,

I just kept lookin' at the side of her face

In the spotlight so clear.

And later on as the crowd thinned out

I's just about to do the same,

She was standing there in back of my chair

Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""

I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,

She studied the lines on my face.

I must admit I felt a little uneasy

When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,

Tangled up in blue.



She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe

""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said

""You look like the silent type.""

Then she opened up a book of poems

And handed it to me

Written by an Italian poet

From the thirteenth century.

And every one of them words rang true

And glowed like burnin' coal

Pourin' off of every page

Like it was written in my soul from me to you,

Tangled up in blue.



I lived with them on Montague Street

In a basement down the stairs,

There was music in the cafes at night

And revolution in the air.

Then he started into dealing with slaves

And something inside of him died.

She had to sell everything she owned

And froze up inside.

And when finally the bottom fell out

I became withdrawn,

The only thing I knew how to do

Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,

Tangled up in blue.



So now I'm goin' back again,

I got to get to her somehow.

All the people we used to know

They're an illusion to me now.

Some are mathematicians

Some are carpenter's wives.

Don't know how it all got started,

I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.

But me, I'm still on the road

Headin' for another joint

We always did feel the same,

We just saw it from a different point of view,

Tangled up in blue.",Rock

And you make me feel

Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?

Could you feel the same way too?

And I am never invited

Now I am here, talking to you

And the way you see through me

But it means a lot to me

You and I go shopping and find exactly what we're looking for

You and I go shopping and fall asleep inside the mattress store.

Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.



And it would be a shame if you leave

And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.



The years we had were not all bad

In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.

And now you say that you've grown tired

And you want to be by yourself a while.



It would be a shame if you go

And find that freedom was a long time ago



I know you can't stand for chains to bind you

But they just keep on driving us apart.

And you could go where I would never find you

But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.



So one more time for old times sake

Come and lay your head upon my chest.

Please don't throw this moment away.

We can forget the bad and take the best.



And if you don't have nothing left to say

Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.

And if you don't have nothing left to say

Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.",Country

Funny I should be the last to know

But it's enough to make a grown man cry

Cos I can feel you slipping through my fingers

I don't even know the reason why



Every day it's a losing battle

Just to smile and hold my head up high

Could it be that we belong together

Baby won't you give me one more try

One more try

Cutting me up, deeper and deeper

Fills me with a sadness that I can't hide

Your flowers are all withering
Your mother's gone missing
Your leaves have drifted away

Burning incandescently

But you're just like your father

Buried deep under the water

You're resting on your laurels

And stepping on my toes



Whose side are you on?

What side is this anyways?

Put down your sword and crown

Come lay with me on the ground



You come beating like moth's wings

Spastic and violently

Whipping me into a storm

Shaking me down to the core



But you've run away from me

And you've left me shimmering

Like diamond wedding rings

Spinning dizzily down on the ground



But you're just like your father

Buried deep under the water

You're resting on your laurels

And stepping on my toes



Whose side are you on?

What side is this anyways?

Put down your sword and crown

Come lay with me on the ground",Electronic

"[Intro - Ja Rule - talking]
Yeah ... ha, uh huh
You know how we do (we're gonna do how we do)
Uh, uh, yo my nigga Cad what's hangin nigga (gangsta shit)
Nigga Terry what's goin on nigga
Let me talk to 'em for a minute (Murder Inc. bosses in the building)

Yeah, haha



[Chorus]

Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked

Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot

Cause it's all about the benjamins and nobody ain't doin it like us

C'mon what y'all want?



Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked

Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot

Cause it's all about sex, money, and murder

Bitches that burn ya, niggas with burners

Cocked and let go!



[Verse 1]

Fuck all y'all motherfuckin bitch ass niggas

I'm talkin to whoever wanna be ridin my dick

And you know your gon' get it as hot as I spit it

It's the Rule and nobody wanna be bothered with

If I hit 'em in every direction with four fifths

Will expend like 45's with compact discs (c'mon)

It's a disappointment to see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed

When I'm one of rap's anointed

Who else used to order it all on the dick

Like when I come through with spinners on the six

And got bitches bouncin like Ronnie in Tricks

But some whores in this game really don't make sense

Bomb roof and via Cal's and clonin Ems

But when bullets go through your film, we break your limbs

A horror show, yeah picture this

Cause I guess you can't see it, it's Murder again



[Chorus]



[Verse 2]

Rule I fuck with bitches in Manolos and thick Louie Vuitton logos

Cause I don't love these hoes

I'm above and beyond everything that your seein

And I'm the only real nigga left rappin this freakin

If I could be one of the seasons, you'd call me summer

The way I bang the heater out the back of the Hummer

The bull just move like runners from city block to city block

Layin down the foundation for what's really hot

Y'all niggas really not on my level (c'mon)

I'm like slugs when they pierce the metal, you see sparks (what)

My voice is a brush, they hear it it's like art

And nobody can really tell the twins apart

I call one Nina, other one Santa Maria

I might roll up on your set, dump and lean ya

My bitch is cocked to bang men in Virginia

Don't make me run up on ya, put a few in ya



[Chorus]



[Verse 3]

Yeah, yeah, yo, Murder's outlaw, that guess I get a city's a broads

So I push the Porsche high and truck to court

Holla at the judge if the judge made a bad decision

I feel like the nigga that triggerin guns with mittens

It's hard to get done, I'm hearin that security runs

around 30K, if they don't get hit with an AK

And found out that the security's runnin another way

Like with me, it's Murder, probably

If I could drop in to manslaughter get a bail and flee

Cause my downess says bitch up, let her handle the pick up

Snow cone the country leave no market untouched

Call me drugs if this is how they pushin us rafters

But I don't do it cause I need it, I do it cause I want more

Definition is greed, I do it cause I want yours

And y'all niggas is teasin, y'all don't really want war

But if you really do, your gonna need a lot more



[Chorus] - 2X



[Outro - Ja Rule - talking]

Faggots, haha (Panna Banana what up)

Yeah, shout out to my nigga 01 (my nigga Holla, I see you baby)

Baby, you know what I mean? My nigga Black Child (Joe, what up nigga)

Big Caddillac, my motherfuckin partner my brother

What up Gotti, you know how we gonna do these niggas

You ain't got to pick up no mic either my nigga

I see you looking and I know what you think
You're getting braver with every drink but
I am telling you something you need to know

She may look like a sweet young thing

Talking to him but she ain't hearing a thing

If you were smart you'd turn around and let her go



That girls' a Barbie doll

A Barbie doll

She's real good-looking but she's got no heart at all



She puts on her makeup and drives to the bar in her

Boyfriend's old man's brand-new car

She's got no idea what she does or why



She does whatever she wants I guess

Whatever comes first or whatever looks best

Nobody I know has ever seen her cry



(Chorus)



You should have seen her last Saturday night

She had a friend of mine treating her right

She was hanging on him until she found a better deal



You should have seen how cold she got

My buddy asked why and she said why not

Nobody I know swears she's even real

When Tom came home his hair was combed
He bought snakeskin boots in Rome
That's not like him
His socks are clean, his shirt is pressed

It isn't just the way he's dressed

He smiles out of context and acts so polite

He's staying at his cousin's overnight

The protein shakes, that's not like him

The carrot cakes, that's not like him

The oatbran flakes, that's not like him

And the sweet name he called me in his sleep last night

Oh, that's not like him



He whispers on the telephone

He goes out smelling of cologne

That's not like him

It's just a superficial thing

But he's misplaced his wedding ring

He's become quite a connoisseur of wine

He's quoting Yeats and Gertrude Stein

The Soho pub, that's not like him

The racquet club, that's not like him

Those books on love, that's not like him

And the sweet name he called me in his sleep last night

Oh, that's not like him



I caught a glimpse of Tom today

At a checkout counter, about to pay

He had a girl on his arm

I'm glad he's helping out the poor

It's not like the Tom I knew before

Something so touching it made me cry

But my heart was racing, I don't know why

Those new blue suede shoes, that's not like him

The Ray Ban shades, that's not like him

Those downtown ways, that's not like him

And the sweet name he called me in his sleep last night

Oh, that's not like him



The red suspenders, that's not like him

The berries in the blender, that's not like him

Those twelve step groups, that's not like him

And Guadeloupe, that's not like him

Those books on Zen, that's not like him

The Karate classes, that's not like him

The fishing gear, that's not like him

Not like him, That's not like him",Rock

Sometimes his eyes shed tiny teardrops when he plays
His touching ballads are just there sitting to buy
They call it music but it seems more like a lie

Life is so boring project theirs onto yours

Hear the anthems of the pepsi generation

See the martyrs of our spiritual degradation

Artificial life in the marketplace

Screen in your living room

A window for your tomb

If you cant compare to the world sitting there

Repress your insecurities watch and escape

Give me artificial give me superficial

Give me a commercial life that can't be bought

Gonna make you my wife

Raise a family

è un fuoco che mi scoppia dentro, 
ti sento, un brivido lungo la schiena 

un colpo che fa pieno centro! 



Mi ami o no ... mi ami o no .... mi ami? 

Che mi resta di te, della tua poesia 

mentre l'ombra del sogno lenta scivola via 

se non ha anima ... anima 



Ti sento, bellissima statua sommersa 

seduti, sdraiati, impacciati! 

Ti sento atlantide isola persa, 

amanti soltanto accennati ! 

mi ami o no ... mi ami o no .... mi ami ? 

Ti sento, deserto lontano miraggio

ti sento, nell'aria un amore selvaggio,

Before you'll come and shine again on us

I've reached the shore

And nothing ever changed

In a thousand waves

And all I see is your face

All I see is your face

wait until the time has come

figure that's where time comes from

leaving all my senses numb

anything could never be

anything but play to me

in order

fallen into something deep

A glimpse beyond the world I know
An open door that I walk through?
And falling from the sky,

a tear before the rain.

But it will pass me by -

holding back again...



A man possessed wings to fly

beyond this space and time

The rhythm of this heart of mine

Is beating like a battle cry



And if I let it go

Will strength provide relief

from fearful winds that blow -

only disbelief



Tears falling

I'm calling

out into the air

My sun is rising where I stand - (I know)



One day I wake up

and suddenly I'm found

High flying man has been unbound (and so)

as all becomes so clear



now tears that fall are all around

and rainbows in the sky appear



Tears falling

I'm standing in the light

"[Saul Williams:]
I drive a yellow Volvo
'86 submarine
Someone's behind me in an escalade trying to blind me with their high beams
I make a left
I'm the road to nowhere, heading west

The sky is purple streaks

The sun is setting in my chest

I feel warm inside

So I'm going for a ride

Put your picture on my dashboard 'till my fate and yours collides



[Mia Doi Todd:]

Seaweed... washed upon the shore...

Severed locks of he who walks the ocean's floor



[Saul Williams:]

Got a yellow Volvo

'86 submarine

Rims like Tibetan prayer wheels and my tank is filled with dreams

Fuck the game, I practice being in the passing lane

And watch the price of gasoline rise with the price of fame

I'm immortal

I render unto Caesar to be cordial

He sees a wooden casket where I see a glowing portal

Check your engine, looks like you're running on the blood of Indians

Put some turquoise in that Rolls Royce before you crash into a pendulum

Seaweed... washed upon the shore...

Severed locks of he who walks the ocean's floor

I drive a yellow Volvo

'86 submarine

I drove it under water guided by my own high beams

Nothing's left

Witnessed the demolition of the west

Felt like a little kid hiding in my mothers' dress

I'm in space

The lone ambassador of every race

The starfish that discover me plant their flags into my face

I'm a clone of every written and unwritten poem

A shark pulls up beside me fingering beads and chanting ""Om""

I can't believe it

I never really thought that sharks would need it

I thought they'd made their peace: bite it, bleed it, kill it, eat it

But I was wrong

Every living being deserves a song

"Here comes Pockets
His trousers hold a thousand deadly sins
The maddest things we ever found in bins
He clutches them and looks at you and grins
Here comes Pockets

The children wary of what they may contain

The linen may have changed, the contents same

A trouser-treasure island with no name



And socially at the platform that the timetable forgot

Picking up used tickets in a station of have-nots

When you're on that train of thought

You pass some pretty funky stops

When you're on that train of thought

You pass some pretty funky stops

That's the Pocket, let him be

That's the Pocket, let him be



Here comes Pockets

Picking up the things we cannot see

A bicycle, a dame, a Christmas tree

Things of no value to you or me



Here comes Pockets

Reduced through history to just a crawl

History turns the tall into the small

But natural born trawlers love to trawl



And the guitar of his dreams hangs upon some wall

Or laying underneath the staircase in a hall

We can carry dreams but we can't hold them all

That's why we learn the Blues before we actually fall

That's the Pocket, let him be

That's the Pocket, let him be



And he's clinging on to hope

Like the oak tree to the gale

'Cause finding one love letter in a sky high jumble sale

His sacrifice the life he lived or the life he served 



He gave his life to save this world with no thought of his own

The light will shine again for us for he has saved our souls

Calibré pour être sûr que tout est réglo'

Qui vais-je baiser : la mienne ou la tienne ?

Ne parlent que de elles, la Terre ne parle que de haine

Il ne serait plus jamais le même

J'innove, peine et amour, amour et douleur

Si ça vaut le coup je souffrirais comme gens de couleur

Mon cur, souvent de mauvaise humeur

Si tu es la bonne je ne serai plus un killer

Tranquila tu andas conmigo

Y yo aqui controlo cómodo

Si quieres te quedas el week-end

Y usas el Ferrari o el Lambo

Pidelo que tu quieras ma

Lo que sea que yo hago el arreglo

Y si quieres nos vamos de vacaciones

Y viajamos todo el año

Dime que tengo que hacer para complacerte memememesita

Que es lo que tengo que hacer

Que es lo mas que tu quieres, que tu necesitas

Pideme lo que deseas, y yo te lo compro

Quieres Gucci, Louis Vuitton o de Versace un bolso

Todo lo que me digas

Bebe lo que tu pidas

Tu sabes mi cielo contra ti yo doy la vida

Te ofresco algo de beber, dime que te place

Dom Perignon, Moët, quiza te complace

Busca el traje de baño que nos vamos en el yate

De mi socio Booba

Por todo el Caraïbe

Y amanecemos en Aruba

"Cool breeze and autumn leaves
Slow motion daylight
A lone pair of watchful eyes
Oversee the living
Feel the presence all around
A tortured soul

A wound unhealing

If time will set you free

Time now to spread your wings

To take to flight

The life endeavour

Aim for the burning sun

You're trapped inside

But you can still be free

If time will set you free

But it's a long long way to go



Keep moving way up high

You see the light

It shines forever

Sail through the crimson skies

The purest light

The light that sets you free

If time will set you free



Sail through the wind and rain tonight

You're free to fly tonight

And you can still be free

If time will set you free

And going higher than the mountain tops

And go high like the wind don't stop

And go high

remember you have still got a friend
I'll meet you at the Parthenon
that's the place we always went
it's been so dull since you left Nashville

I've read the same books again & again

it makes me wish I wasn't bashful

when it comes to other men



but if I could have my way

Darling you'd come home



remember when you moved to Nashville

& the first time that we kissed

remember when your mother found us

remember that you're sorely missed



& when you make it back to Nashville

we'll forget all of your sins

& I still buy two pairs of everything

so when you come home you & I'll be twins

"Hard times spreading just like the flu
Watch out homeboy, don't let it catch you
P-p-prices go up, don't let your pocket go down
When you got short money you're stuck on the ground
Turn around, get ready, keep your eye on the prize
And be on point for the future shock



Hard times [repeat 2x]



Hard times are coming to your town

So stay alert, don't let them get you down

They tell you times are tough, you hear that times are hard

But when you work for that ace you know you pulled the right card

Hard times got our pockets all in chains

I'll tell you what, homeboy, it don't have my brain

All day I have to work at my peak

Beacuse I need that dollar every day of the weak



Hard times



Hard times can take you on a natural trip

So keep your balance, and don't you slip

Hard times is nothing new on me

I'm gonna use my strong mentality

Like the cream of the crop, like the crop of the cream

B-b-beating hard times, that is my theme

Hard times in life, hard times in death

I'm gonna keep on fighting to my very last breath

"Mouth of dust and ruptured windpipe
Fairytales for lying cheats
They'll lashing out like wolves in barbed-wire
Ring the bells and stop the fires, now...

The red white and the blue has always been what led you

If you don't do something they'll steal it all from under you



Board decisions, bored children

Watch the world through gun-sight eyes

I hijack train-wrecks, sell the wheels

No way out unless you steal it all



The red white and the blue has always been what led you

If you don't do something they'll steal it all from under you

"The signal is subtle
We pass just close enough to touch
No questions, no answers
We know by now to say enough
With only simple words
With only subtle turns

The things we feel alone for one another



There is a secret that we keep

I won't sleep if you won't sleep

Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given

We are compelled to do what we must do

We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden



So I won't sleep if you won't sleep tonight



Our act of defiance

We keep this secret in our blood

No paper or letters

We pass just close enough to touch

We love in secret names

We hide within our veins

The things that keep us bound to one another 



There is a secret that we keep

I won't sleep if you won't sleep

Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given

We are compelled to do what we must do

We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden



Until the last trace and this hope 

Is frozen deep inside my bones

And this broken fate has claimed me

And my memories for its own

Your name is pounding through my veins

Can't you hear how it is sung?

And I can taste you in my mouth

Before the words escape my lungs

And I'll whisper only once...



There is a secret that we keep

I won't sleep if you won't sleep

Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given

We are compelled to do what we have to

We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden



'Cause you will be somebody's girl 

And you will keep each other warm

But tonight I am feeling cold",Rock

Taught young in legends

Wandering aimlessly, oh what can I do?

Over to you

Future looks blue

What can I do?



Watching for freedom

Fighting our wars

Feeding our children

Keeping your laws

Someday you'll suffer

And what I'll do

I'll hand all your promises

Standing inside myself, I'm losing control

You made me believe in the stories you told

Waiting impatiently, what else can I do?

I handed my future over to you, to you



Over to you

What can I do?



Tears filled of sadness

Stealing myself

Which burning secrets?

What to they tell?

Mad politicians

Can tell it true

Oh! Will you never set me free?

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces

An airline ticket to romantic places

And still my heart has wings

These foolish things remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant

A fair ground's painted swings

These foolish things remind me of you

You came you saw you conquer'd me

When you did that to me

I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

These foolish things remind me of you



First daffodils and long excited cables

And candle lights on little corner tables

And still my heart has wings

These foolish things remind me of you

The park at evening when the bell has sounded

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it

The beauty that is Spring's

These foolish things remind me of you

How strange how sweet to find you still

These things are dear to me

They seem to bring you near to me

The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

These foolish things remind me of you



Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

And still my heart has wings

These foolish things remind me of you

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes

The song that Crosby sings

These foolish things remind me of you

How strange how sweet to find you still

These things are dear to me

They seem to bring you near to me

The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

These foolish things remind me of you

"Procuro olvidarte
Siguiendo la ruta
De un pájaro herido.
Procuro alejarme
De aquellos lugares
Donde nos quisimos.

Me enredo en amores

Sin ganas ni fuerzas por ver si te

Olvido

Y llega la noche y de nuevo

Comprendo

Que te nenecito.



Procuro olvidarte

Haciendo en el día

Mil cosas distintas

Procuro olvidarte



Pisando y contando

Las hojas caidas

Procuro cansarme

Llegar a la noche apenas sin vida

Y al ver nuestra casa tan sola y callada

No se lo que haría



Lo que haría, por que estuvieras tu,

Porque siguieras tú conmigo,

Lo que haría, por no sentirme así,

Por no vivir así perdido",Jazz

So gentle when he tries to understand

This subterfuge he never really planned

A democracy of sorts that justifies the sum

"Slowly and steadily MC's are fallin off like leprosy
Instead build immunity and spread insight through community
These fundamentals, form the krux of longevity
When melodies are looped and vocals harmonize in unity
Now its 99 and aint a damn thing changed
Some seek fame as wealth manipulates the brain

Let me, paint this picture, your minds the canvas

Many claim their real and later flake like dandruff

Cause 1 out of 10 stick to their words

The other 9 stick to my nikes and get rubbed out on the curb

Lets be real, we're paper chasin' for financial backing

But theres a thin line defined by need and greed many are passing

Known as crossing over for exposure some embark

Or cars,jewels and shit that wont exist when we depart

Crews, don't snooze, or eyes become bruised



This goes out to those that slept knew the deal or were confused..

Check the blueprint..



[Chorus]

So MC's, take it back to lyricism

Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm

DJ's pay bills develop skills

And respect the architecht as we begin to build

And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive

And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive

And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills..

[scratch]

So respect the architect as we begin to build



Clutchin my pen tight strugglin to portray the right depiction

I'm punchin the wall of writers block, loathing for recognition

Nowadays your not heard, unless your posing an image

With watered down lyrics that appeal to most who listen

Instead i'll water the roots so branches will replenish

Expanding elements that pioneers started building

Hiphop houses, so many free loading MC's

I feel theres only a few tenants who've been paying their fees

360 degrees what goes around comes back

I'm smoking mics as I inhale lies and exhale facts

Unfold the blueprints, the plans for improvement

Bridging gaps between the mind, ball point pen and the clueless

Innovation is useless once you forget the essence

So respect the architect. pick up your pens and start sketchin

Pick up your pens and start sketching..



[Chorus]

So MC's, take it back to lyricism

Producers, pour out your heart into the rhythm

And respect the architecht as we begin to build

And check the blueprint, to keep the culture alive

And check the blueprint so as an artist you can survive

And check the blueprint I speak these words without frills

[scratch]

So respect the architect as we begin to build



As I open my slanty eyes to this place called earth

I contemplate how music has lost artistic worth

And I'm shrivled up in my niche like the scrotum when its freezing

With bags under my eyes on account of too much sleeping

Because of these lies in rap that I can't feel

Leaving me dazed with the phrase ""i keep it real""

How many times have you heard this being fed through your ears

I'd rather be fed in the mouth, to shit it out from the rear

Claiming their underground but underwater their wrinkling

And me like water buoys to that level I'm never sinking

Sink your teeth into my words hard enough to be lispin'

Then when finished biting them, find your front teeth missing

I see em sippin fine wines in spas, to match their image

Gimmicks.. I flap my jaws and their squads diminished

I don't mess with glocks but metaphorically in speech

I'd like to pump em' with more shots than diabetics receive

Then in a better place may they peacefully rest

In hopes that next time the blueprints they'll manifest

Check the blueprint...

"Momma never said it would be like this
I never knew such bliss existed
Or maybe it's just so indescribable
Love was liable to get her twisted
She never told me but if she tried I was a little too young it floated right by me
I never dreamed love so fulfilling it's simply killing and over spilling on me

It goes on and on ... 



This ain't no ordinary love

Gonna tell everyone up under the sun



I refuse to believe we're a dying breed

Children of peace hope and harmony

Ordinary folks extraordinary love

Something from above

Something we fall short of

You can't see with an untrained eye 

But if you take a little time you are sure to find it

We complicate something so basic 

But once you taste it you gonna chase it like me

It goes on and on ...



A - yo here we go, open up the gates and let it flow ... 

Love's gonna take us higher



This ain't no ordinary love

It's extraordinary love",Rap

I get lost in it's eyes as it stares into mine

And see an ounce of pain

"Wouldn't it be great to see the African plains
Before they lay them to waste and only the bones remain?
Wouldn't it be poetry to shoot holes in the poachers we see with an elephant gun?
Men in helicopters fly, shooting rhinos from out of the sky
Why do we always assume the planet is ours to ruin?
What a legacy we're leaving behind, what a legacy

Wouldn't it be something for the men killing dolphin

To be caught up by their necks in their greedy fishing nets?

Wouldn't it be irony if the tuna fish canneries were to fall into the sea?

The dolphins and the whales still left alive cry to the stars in the deep blue night

""There's nowhere to hide, the people on Earth will not be denied""

What a legacy we're leaving behind, what a legacy



Wouldn't it be odd if there really was a God

And he looked down on Earth and saw what we've done to her?

Wouldn't it be just if he pulled the plug on us and took away the Sun?

"Buy now, I kill for a living
Buy now, I kill for a living
I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin

makes your heat pistons freeze

I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures

With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers

Who discredit theories and behead your mentors

Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge

I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst

Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over

Wearing grim smirks

They would like me to convert my gritty edge

To unearth my earning potential

But my face is so sun burnt

Due to all the grassroots grunt work

That I won't be co-opted

And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped

But I'm a street vendor kinds sir

This style-free is dopamine

It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening



You can join my suicide cult

Membership is free

Take these cyanide eye-drops

And peppermint hemlock

This is what you have been billed for

Dancing on the kill floor

To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

This is what you have been killed for

Dancing on the kill floor

To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score



Contrast bohemia to my workplace

When I'm racing in carpool lane

to sell shit to an art school lame

-Don't you think you're hot shit

Well what do you have to offer-

A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe

But they can they pinpoint and nail

My distance between art and commerce

With just an invoice of a sale

I will disappoint an ail

Those who want to deny us the majority rule

When a will jump in my primordial pool

Without knowing where their swim trunks were

But not everyone knows

What they're called on to encumber

You can't know by just logging on with a pin number

Buy now

You pasty Brits

Buy now

You crazy chicks

Buy

Cuz I don't pay attention to rules,

regulations or safety tips

Love us

Eligible bachelors

Love us

Cuz we're the Blowed rappers

Loved

Cuz I tour the country so much

I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas

Unrelated to your three-legged

preachy bootleggers will do away with you

CD duplicators make vegans

Do the salad bar swing-pivot

Wave your valid parking tickets

At the endangered sea-urchin

Tell me the name of your political activist key person

And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version

Of the infamous rap rant

Trickling down the baggy pant leg

of this unhappy class aid

Covered in shell fragments of this

Graffiti tagged glass egg

I can sell anything to a hip-hopper

like it's my cathartic something

But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting



You can dance to death

And for no extra charge

Give me your debit card

So you can have sex with stars

This is what you have been billed for

Dancing on the kill floor

To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

This is what you have been billed for

Dancing on the kill floor

To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

Railroad Bill, the engineer said, ""Boy, we'll have to fly!""
We've got to be on time, to meet old Number Four.
So sling the coal, we'll make it, boy, or never ride no more.

While in the rear boxcar, a lonely hobo lay,

Heading for his mother dear, who on her death-bed lay;

He raised a weary hand, to brush away a tear,

Not knowing his last drive was run, and Fate was drawing near.



When through the darkened night, a headlight bright did gleam,

O'er the roar of rolling wheels, a whistle load did scream;

As down around the curve, the mighty train did roar,

With black smoke rolling from the stack, came Flyer Number Four.



Then came an awful crash! Their last long drive was run,

On the track the hobo lay, his days of life were done;

And as the golden sun, sank slowly to the west,

It's gonna feel real good, gonna make a difference 
Gonna make it right... 
As I, turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat 
This wind is blowin' my mind 

I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat 

Who am I, to be blind? 

Pretending not to see their needs 

A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top 

And a one man's soul 

They follow each other on the wind ya' know 

'Cause they got no where to go 

That's why I want you to know 



I'm starting with the man in the mirror 

I'm asking him to change his ways 

And no message could have been any clearer 

If you wanna make the world a better place 

Take a look at yourself, and then make a change 



(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah) 



I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love 

It's time that I realize 

That there are some with no home, not a nickle to loan 

Could it really be me, pretending that they're not alone? 



A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart 

And a washed-out dream 

(Washed out dream) 

They follow the pattern of the wind, ya' see 

'Cause they got no place to be 

That's why I'm starting with me 



I'm starting with the man in the mirror 

I'm asking him to change his ways 

And no message could have been any clearer 

If you wanna make the world a better place 

Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

""At least I think I was here asleep...
Is it possible, conceiveable that I sleepwalked out of my apartment

And went berzerk?""



[Aesop Rock]

In slipped rhythm

Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta

Escaped briefly back to my apartment

Parked in front the fan

And reminesce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my hand

'Tesants get the New York home game

With real life shoot-em-up action

Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art

Free game piece all included

I told this cat the earth was flat

He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself for being stupid

Brick-a-back novelty

Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey

Godspeed Tequilla worm future, be concerned

My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings

While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings

I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection

I'm stubborn as a thousand born agains avoiding questions

From the alpha to the sand

I bake the date up for my pledge

To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled

Not a creature stirred, it reaks of subway metal

Feather lecture journalist chin on fish shenanigans

Recording mayhem with voices

Benefit to break room

Mummified manequins with future cleanse adamant

And skeleton in cabinet

This a Malcom circus, got a ring of fire

Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle

I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew

Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you SUCKA!

I lay the Lord down upon its belly

With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk

Yelling 'Break yo'self!'

I'm the actualized data commission past penny tip jar donation

Been arranged, made by the farfetch from stability 

Took a heart pledge early on

Bled onto the drum doser

Plow in the metronome, home 

Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster

Sensation'll leave siesomgraph stabbin away on stone tablets

To sketch up out your future

I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand

But have canceled developed, courtesy America

Land of the free base

Home of the triplicate grill character

My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker

It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed

With dilapadated winter jacket

I rock a crooked lid piece

A sweat a bit to make my Wookie ends meet

Pascifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed

Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate

Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit

Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit apparently

Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh at me'

Ok, time to buckle the fuck down 

Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin

You can catch the memoir in several dimensions

The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process

Hence, your plight botches



""I don't know what got into me

I didn't even cause all that destruction

I'm sorry...so sorry""

Anything to keep me in check through the day.

I might need a sedative,

But I hate the taste of medicine.

""You just need to let her go.""

These pills shaking in my hand

Just make me feel defeated,

Like I'm not able to just let her go away.



I hate this place but I love these chords.

""An empty fate just means an even score.""

And the pain this morning...

It filled my head.

It's Jameson.

It means that I'm not dead.



And I just can't seem to get away

There's no such thing as escape,

Even with the sedaives

Clutching to a limbo scene.

You're never changing anything,

You just stop the shaking.

And chaos it will bring.

Better watch your tone!

Rock is not The Devil's work,

It's magical and rad.

I'll never rock as long as I am stuck here with my dad



I hear you brave young Jaybles,

You are hungry for the rock.

But to learn the ancient method,

Sacred doors you must unlock.

Escape your father's clutches,

And this oppressive neighborhood.

On a journey you must go,

To find the land of Hollywood!

In The City of Fallen Angels,

Where the ocean meets the sand,

You will form a strong alliance,

And the world's most awesome band.

To find your fame and fortune,

Through the valley you must walk.

You will face your inner demons.

Now go my son and rock!



So he went from fuckin' Kickapoo With hunger in his heart;

And he journeyed far and wide to find the secrets of his art;

But in the end he knew that he would find his counterpart.

Bring us your trinkets, your baubles of gold
Join the debauchery, the young and the old
Let us bow down to his great golden calf

Darken our spirits, as we dance and we laugh



The golden calf takes shape - the idol of black hearts

The whole deed, from the sum of its parts

From the healer of sorrow came a great molten blast

With holy tongue of fire, the commandments were cast



Down from the mountain with two tablets of stone

In countenanc white, Moses walked down alone

Instructed by God to bring the people His word

Intoxicated by evil, their judgment obscured

Why should we listen to his set of his rules ?

Deeper in sin sinks the assembly of fools



Though shalt not make graven images

Visiting evil in the land of the dust

Though shalt not have other gods before Me

Then only then can you truly be free

Melt down this idol and the evil it brings",Metal

I said ""there needs to be some changes made""

gonna be some, gonna be some changes made

gonna be some changes made!



gonna be some changes, changes made



can't keep on doing what i've been doing these days



look in the mirror i see a clown's face



some changes made



going home, i've done enough to sow my little name



going where the fields are green and I can do my macram



a buffoon fumblin' without a clue, who likes to shift the blame



and often feels betrayed



... there's gonna be some changes made



there's gonna be some changes made



gonna be some changes, changes made



can't keep on doing what i've been doing these days



look in the mirror I see a clown's face



gotta take it off, gotta get myself straight

"La la la aaaa
In a house
on an island
there's a tale that must be told
of our mysterious Misty Mountains

behind all the songs I wrote

lives an old man in his shadow

and they're whistling day and night

for whatever whatever its worth for

they are whistling for you and I



On a ranch in the wildness

there's a song that must be sung

about a blindfolded angel 

who never learned the right from wrong

and though I don't know enough English

to describe it's troubled mind

but for one thing I am certain 

is that it sings for you and I



And I tried so hard to figuring out 

but I guess I'm only human

I've been watching him drawing him

analysing him in every way

I could possible think of



but does not really help me

you got to sit back and enjoy

you know Ochrasy raised and betrayed him 

now he sits there all alone

with his soul and his legend and his epic melodies

they are with us when we crying

and they are with us when we bleed



Yes they are with us when we crying 

and they are with us when we bleed

You will remember this for the longest time

Illusions in words confusing me

Although you couldn't have jacked the disrespect

The technique, sweat meet, wipe off the sweat

Fight off the shit and flush the waste down

The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground

Why my purpose on the surface of this earth is

Plan it, standards, trust and the purpose

Campaign in vein for the same lame fame, people obtain, you ought to be detained

By the hip hop sheriff, locked up

no possibility of getting out cause the shit you make is killing me and my ears, and my peers

I hear the end is near, no fear

we disappear, then reappear again in a fresh new light

I hope its peaceful and cloudy cause if its not we gotta fight like, fight like

"Through the mud and quicksand
Through the undergrowth and vines
We hacked our way along
We had to crawl, we had to climb

Just what was it that pulled us?

It was not riches, nor was it glory

It was affection, and when we found it 

It was sublime



We searched both high and low for what we found in each others' arms, dear

We quested far and wide, while never knowing that it was so near

Now we are explorers of the heart



Trekking over sand dunes

We braved the heat of desert suns

Knowing that we'd rest, at last 

only when we were done



What thing was it that drew us 

Out of our homes and onwards and upwards

It was affection, and when we found it,

It was sublime



We searched both high and low for what we found in each others' arms, dear

We quested far and wide, while never knowing that it was so near

Now there is one place left for us to conquer, one more frontier

Now we are explorers of the heart



In the ocean deep

On the mountain high

In the valley low

Across the river wide

Is where we found it



Climbing over glaciers

Up from the fjords and over ice

Trudging through the snow banks

Relentlessness our only vice



Just what was it that pulled us 

Out of our homes and onwards and upwards

It was affection, and when we found it,

It was sublime



We searched both high and low for what we found in each others' arms, dear

We quested far and wide, while never knowing that it was so near

Now there is one place left for us to conquer, one more frontier

There is no turning back, forget your doubts and ignore your fears

How can you sleep?
How can you sleep through this?
What are your thoughts?
As you turn to dream?

I never look

These things are hard

These things can hurt

All of the secrets

Nobody needs to know

How does it feel?

Falling asleep so hard

How could ask?

How could I say?

The things I need to

You'd go away

Goodnight

Memory must

Fill you with love

Positive days

Positive years

Older than lonely

Older than old

There's only minutes

Minutes to go

You have to feel this

You have to cry

I can go on

I can deny

This stuff it hurts

Always it will

Now I can ask

Now I can say

The things I need to

You've gone away

"(feat. willie nelson, waylon jennings, kris kristofferson) i personify a highwayman. along the coach roads i did ride with sword and pistol by my side many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade the bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five but i am still alive. i was a sailor. i was carry upon the tide and with the sea i did abide. i sailed a schooner round the horn to mexico i went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow and when the yards expose off they said that i stimulate down but i cost last still. i was a dam builder across the river deep and wide where steel and water did collide a place called boulder on the wild colorado i slipped and descend into the wet concrete below they entomb me in that great tomb that recognize no sound but i am still around..i'll always be around..and around and around and around and around i fly a starship across the universe divide and when i reach the other side i'll find a place to breathe my spirit if i can perhaps i may become a highwayman again or i may simply be a single drop of rain but i will persist and i'll be back again, and again and again and again and again..",Country

My darlin' you're so fine
Oh

But darlin' I'll find a way

As life's most precious part

yeah, cross my heart and hope to die,

if beauty is only skin deep,

then thankfully i am blind,

cross my heart, come cross the line,

won't you be mine, my bloody valentine?

Put me on a pedestal, i'll put you on a slab !!!!!

Cross my heart and hope to die,

come, let's cross the line,

there's a fine line, between love and hate,

let's tear it apart,



cross my heart, and hope to die,

cross my heart, come let's cross the line,



time is no great healer, quickly the senses numb,

come cross my heart, void and null,

love is a weakness, lust conquers all,

cross my heart and hope to die,

"How here's a little story - I've got to tell
About three bad brothers - you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock, M.C.A., and me - Mike D.
Been had a little horsy named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer

Riding across the land - kicking up sand

Sheriff's posse on my tail cause I'm in demand

One lonely Beastie I be

All by myself - without nobody

The sun is beating down on my baseball hat

The air is gettin' hot - the beer is getting flat

Lookin' for a girl - I ran into a guy

His name is M.C.A., I said, ""Howdy"" - he said, ""Hi""



He told a little story - that sounded well rehearsed

Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst

The brew was in my hand - and he was on my tip

His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry - he asked me for a sip

He said, ""Can I get some?""

I said, ""You can't get none!""

Had a chance to run

He pulled out his shotgun

He was quick on the draw - I thought I'd be dead

He put the gun to my head and this is what he said,



""Now my name is M.C.A. - I've got a license to kill

I think you know what time it is - it's time to get ill

Now what do we have here - an outlaw and his beer

I run this land, you understand - I make myself clear.""

We stepped into the wind - he had a gun, I had a grin

You think this story's over but it's ready to begin



""Now I got the gun - you got the brew

You got two choices of what you can do

It's not a tough decision as you can see

I can blow you away or you can ride with me"" I said, I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border

The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter

I did it like this - I did it like that

I did it with a whiffleball bat

So I'm on the run - the cop's got my gun

And right about now - it's time to have some fun

The King Adrock - that is my name

And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.""

We rode for six hours the we hit the spot

The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot

This dude was staring like he knows who we are

We took the empty spot next to him at the bar

M.C.A. said, ""Yo, you know this kid?""

I said, ""I didn't."" - but I know he did

The kid said, ""Get ready cause this ain't funny

My name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money.""

Pulled out the jammy - aimed it at the sky

He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" - and let two fly

Hands went up and people hit the floor

He wasted two kids that ran for the door

""I'm Mike D. and I get respect

Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect""

M.C.A. was with it and he's my ace

So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face

The piano player's out - the music stopped

His boy had beef - and he got dropped

Mike D. grabbed the money - M.C.A. snatched the gold

I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold",Rock

to whom no spring shall ever dawn
We are a window to the future
The morrow's first polluted yawn
We are a dowry to destruction

In all the shouting we shall drown

We are the shadows of the good times

We are the echo, not the sound

Redolent of meaning lost and gone

Strewn about the airwaves of this new dark age

Still without our substance carry on



We are the widows

The reapers following.
A condemned club for both weak and poor.
I tear my new flesh. Ripping and wearing it out.
Trying to rise in a cast only I know exists.

Abstaining my yesterday. Welcome my tomorrow.

Let the present lead. Head my inner bleed.



My acts of foolishness. Victimize the perpetual soil.

I, I, I, I die alone.



Screaming, fighting and tearing my inside.

Screaming fight in me.



This is the first trace of a weak show.

I know that as I take my first step into this freak

show. Lying down on the cold concrete.



Surrounded by my own stench. Panic rising,

Takes me further. This room has never looked this

We all have ways of finding out the things we don't know
The path or truth some find they hear it in a sound
Well I can breathe it in and see the darkness all around
I see things every day in every way
Unleashed unchained and unrestrained so I can say

the death and hate I see I'll bring it to the ground

I can breathe it in and bring entire systems down



Break through baby I've never felt this good

Because I know I've seen what the others should have to see

Who left the light in these blinded eyes?

Street wise soldier I always thought I would bring back

the fight our mothers and fathers could

They rocked the system and changed their lives



I turned my face away

it's the only way to see what I am

so I don't have to breathe



And now I see the sights I had on the are now on me

Tell me when did I go wrong?

Have I been this heartless and selfish and fucked up all along?

How did lose proof?

Did I forget to reach the youth and expose the truth?

But now instead of all the things I thought I shed

The only thing I can really see is that I am already dead

"Just before I tell you standing in the rain 
I would have loved you like no other babe
But a poet needs his pain
And sometimes life can be so cruel
It will pick you up and drop you down again

I'm still searching for the pieces

Someone else once took away

You know I used to love with all my heart

But how the times they can change.



Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know

I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go

Oh I never wanted to be apart

But I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart.



I've seen a lot of heartache and I've walked a lonely road

They say the darkest times before the dawn

But the rooster hasn't crowed

And when you wake up in the morning

Oh my darling I'll be gone



Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know

I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go

Oh I never wanted to be apart

But I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart

No I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart.



So many fools fall in love

And it's a crying game

It's a crying shame

That I'm not a fool in love

But I know what I'm feeling 

And my heart is still healing



Oh my baby's been calling and I want you to know

I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go

Oh I never wanted to be apart

But I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart

No I still don't know if I'm a wounded heart.",Pop

"I know it's been a long time.
You've lost that look in your eye.
The one that told me everything was fine without a word.
But now we're standing face to face,
with nothing left to say but goodbye to yesterday.

I don't know if I can make it.

I don't know if I'm that strong.

I don't know where we went wrong but somehow it's over.

In my mind I see you clearly.

In my dreams I feel you near me.

I want to know, does this feeling go away?



Like shooting stars we shine and then we fade,

breaking the promises we made.

What about the promises?

What about the promises we made?

What about our plans for forever?

Did they scare you?

Did you need to get away?



You taught me many things.

Like how it feels to miss someone so bad

it feels like a part of you is missing.

I can tell you one thing.

Now that you have gone I never will forget you.

You left your mark",Rock

"Last night, I was dreaming 
I was locked in a prison cell 
When I woke up, I was screaming 
Calling out your name

And the judge and the jury 

They all put the blame on me 

They wouldn't go for my story 

They wouldn't hear my plea

Only you can set me free 

'Cos I'm guilty (guilty) 

Guilty as a girl can be 

Come on baby can't you see 

I stand accused of love in the first degree

Someday, I believe it 

You will come to my rescue 

Unchain my heart you're keeping 

And let me start anew

Since they've thrown away the key 

Can't you see that I'm lonely 

Won't you help me please

And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I just believe it, there's nothing to it



I believe I can fly

I believe I can touch the sky

I think about it every night and day

Spread my wings and fly away

I believe I can soar

I see me running through that open door

I believe I can fly

I believe I can fly

I believe I can fly



See I was on the verge of breaking down

Sometimes silence can seem so loud

There are miracles in life I must achieve

But first I know it starts inside of me

If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can touch the sky

"Confessor 
Of the tragedies in man 
Lurking in the core of us all 
The last dying call for the everlost 
Brief encounters, bleeding pain 
Lepers coiled neath the trees 

Dying men in bewildered soliloquys 

Perversions bloom round the bend 

Seekers, lost in their quest 

Ghosts of friends frolic 

under the waning moon 

It is the year of death 

Wielding his instruments 

Stealth sovereign reaper 

Touching us with ease 

Infecting the roots in an instant 

Burning crop of disease 

I am just a spectator 

An advocate documenting the loss 

Fluttering with conceit 

This doesn't concern me yet 

Still far from the knell 

Taunting their bereavement 

Mod round the dead 

Point fingers at the details 

Probing vomits for more 

Caight in unbridled suspense 

We have all lost it now 

Catching the flakes of dismay 

Born the travesty of man 

Regular pulse midst pandemonium 

You're plucked to the mass 

Parched with thirst for the wicked 

Sick liaisons raised this monumental mark 

The sun sets forever over Blackwater park",Metal

"Searching through this violent haze
Contracted by illusions
This mesmerizing dream
To find fragments of resolution
The eyes of eternity

Focus on the myriad forms

As the minds of the conscious crumble

To the weakness their truth must conform



Fragments... of resolution

Fragments... of resolution



Breathing in this misery

Destroying absolution

Victim of a hidden past

Resounding with execution



Motionless are the serpent's eyes

Dripping with your conclusion

Hanging on by a thread of life

Ties are cut with resolution's... knife",Rock

Clean up the streets for our wives and our daughters

But you know, they hanged ole Smack right then instead of later

You know the people were quite pleased

'Cause the outlaw had been seized

And on the whole, it was a very good year

For the undertaker

When my heart is still with you,

And ol' midnight knows it, too.

Does it mean that our love is ending.

You're out of my heart,

And I'm out of my mind.

Let the angels sing,

One little thought to me

Though someone else may be

Nearer your heart?



Once in a while will you dream

Of the moments I shared with you

Moments before we two

Drifted apart?



In love's smoldering ember

One spark may remain

If love still can remember

That spark may burn again



I know that I'll be contented

With yesterday's memory

Knowing you think of me

Once in a while



In love's smoldering ember

One spark may remain

If love still can remember

The spark may burn again



I know that I'll be contented

With yesterday's memory

Knowing you think of me

Once in a while

"[lyrics by Ville Viljanen]
I take a stone and put it away
I take the soil and put it aside
Then mixed them as one

I've seen the stars been born

I've tasted the cosmic universe

When the others sold their world

I did create another dimension

I had created another dimension



Forgotten worlds have been terminated

The whole meaning of mankind is gone



Let planets impale the space

Fly through the nortern sky

We need the moon

like flowers need the rain

eternal journey through the time

let us all fear the day

I am the truth, I am

I am creation



If our peace is broken by another race

we have to fight or stars to fade

in the wind is our last farewells

we hope this fight will never

come to its end



I've seen the stars been born

I've tasted the cosmic universe

When the others left their world

I did create a paradise

I did forget a thousand paradise



Forgotten worlds have been terminated

The whole meaning of mankind is gone



Let planets impale the space

Fly through the nortern sky

We need the moon

like flowers need the rain

eternal journey through the time

let us all fear the day

I am the truth, I am

I am creation",Rock
"There is a man inside a room in the forest
He sits alone upon the chair his father left him
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark with the radio on
The voice crackles when he says that God will save you
He will take you from the lonely life you're living

If you give, if you give, if you give up on what you want



The man stands and pours himself another bourbon

He stops and watches the birds through the winter windows

And the light, and the light from the morning dew



""I thought I love you and our love would be forever

How could I hit you, the only one who ever loved me?""

Said the man, said the man to his shadow



This is the world, this is the world we live in

It's not the one I choose, but it's the one we're given

This is the world, this is the world we live in

And it's the winter windows that ends become beginnings

Yep



As a boy, he was taught he was the bad one

One that could heed the other, the protector

He will walk, he will walk, he will walk into the river



Sixty years held down by his brother

Ten years with the ghost of his father

And five years since he spoke, since he spoke to his only son



This is the world, this is the world we live in

It's not the one I choose, but it's the one we're given

This is the world, this is the world we live in

And it's the winter windows that ends become beginnings

Yes, it's the winter windows that ends become beginnings",Rock

"I can't begin to tell you
How much you mean to me
My world would end
If ever we were through
I can't begin to tell you

How happy I would be

If I could speak my mind

Like others do



I make such pretty speeches

Whenever we're apart

But when you're near

The words I choose

Refuse to leave my heart



So take the sweetest phrases

The world has ever known

And make believe

I've said them all to you

"It was Cinco de Mayo
Pillow case on his head 
No more breathing time 
The ambulance sped
Sped 'round every corner 
Calling out his name



Shot a rabbit from the back seat window

Sat and watched the summer corn grow

Ate ice cream in a dessert dream

And got lost in father's singing

Too hot inside

Too hot outside

Lazy days when I said lets go for a ride

We'd sail on Spirit Lake

Me my pappy and his lemonade



Tim and Tina were my parents names

They got engaged

They were inflamed

Seduced by the luck of butterflies

How they glimmer how they shimmer

Those butterflies



We seven kids

We almost died

Nearly put to death

By lightening strikes

Instead there was hot pink

Flashes in the sky

We climbed the rocks in snow and rain

In search of magic powers

To heal our mother's pain



Shot a rabbit from the back seat window

Sat and watched the summer corn grow

Ate ice cream in a dessert dream

And got lost in father's singing

Too hot inside

Too hot outside

Lazy days when I said lets go for a ride

We'd sail on Spirit Lake

Me my pappy and his lemonade



Shot a rabbit from the back seat window

Sat and watched the summer corn grow

Ate ice cream in a dessert dream

And got lost in father's singing

Too hot inside

Too hot outside

Lazy days when I said lets go for a ride

We'd sail on Spirit Lake

Me my pappy and his lemonade

"Dio has rocked for a long, long time,
Now it's time for him to pass the torch.
He has songs of wildebeests and angels,
He has soared on the wings of a demon.
It's time to pass the torch,

You're too old to rock, no more rockin' for you.

We're takin' you to a home,

But we will sing a song about you.



And we will make sure that you're very well taken care of.

You'll tell us secrets that you've learned. Raow!

Your sauce will mix with ours,

And we'll make a good goulash baby.

Dio, time to go!

You must give your cape and scepter to me.

And a smaller one for KG.

Go! Go! Dio! Dio!",Rock

And dive as deep as man can go
Into those dark places

Knowing it's a matter of having to climb

Above this place these clouds lie

Monarchy now, alive (4 times)

ein Geschenk von meinem Vater
Er sagt vor Gott sind alle gleich,

nur unser Kaiser, der war gleicher, selbst als Leich'



Er sagt, ob Kaiser oder Führer -

alles Kriegsverlierer,

betracht' ich mir seine Orden dann,

dann wird mir manches clearer



Kaiser, Fürsten, Könige - all beliebte Monarchen

erfreut erneut wohin heut der Zug der Zeit sie fährt

Cutting through the spleen

Severing devouring everything

Frothing heaving sucking the air from my lungs

Twisting shapes from thin air

Damaged cells lying everywhere

"What in the world is happening?
What in the world could this be?
I'm on the verge of an awakening
A new kind of strength for me
I feel a force I've never felt before

I don't want to fight it anymore

Feelings so strong can't be ignored

I burst out - I'm transformed



Rising up, shaking it off

The yesterday dreary

Graceful and strong, No more forlorn

Today's a jubilee

Don't be surprised

This change is my design



I feel a force I've never felt before

I don't want to fight it anymore

Feelings so strong can't be ignored

I burst out - I'm transformed



I feel a force I've never felt before

I can't hold it down I've just got to soar

And laugh in the face that is vulture law

I burst out, I'm transformed



I feel a force I've never felt before

I don't want to fight it anymore

Feelings so strong can't be ignored

I burst out - I'm transformed



I feel a force I've never felt before

I can't hold it down I've just got to soar

And laugh in the face that is vulture law

I burst out - I'm transformed

I burst right out - Into a swan

I burst out into a swan

"He bit your lip
And on the tip
Of your tongue
Was your view
The heavy belt
With how you felt

In ways

That tilted you



The paper cuts

From the love letter

You never gave him

Could not meet

Your new found meat

A misbehaving lie



Why

Why would you say sorry

Oh, why would you say

Why would you say



You said there

Was a nagging lack of smiles

Went dancing on your back

Tenderness a plenty book

That wasn't what you craved

His whole thin heart desire

Start to make demands

And he adored you

Would be a fool

To make your plans with her



Why would you say sorry

Oh, why would you

Why would you say sorry

Oh, why would you say sorry

Oh, why would you



When it's just one

Of many bullets

You will bite

While waiting

For a ray of light

Waiting

For a ray of light

Waiting

For a ray of light



The paper cuts

From the love letter

You never gave him

Could not meet

Your new found meat

A misbehaving lie



Why

Why would you say sorry

Oh, why would you

Why would you say sorry

Oh, why would you say sorry

Oh, why would you

Why would you say sorry

"The girl could move, and she did.
We were captives on a casino ship.
Where the midwest lay out hours and burnt to crisp.
I spent a year as her hair lip,
but now I fall apart at night 

and dream about our trip.



But the first two weeks were great,

I felt content to watch the Entertainment Channel fornicate.



With flashes of you maturing into stage,

flawless masterpieces built of dreams I swore were memories.



And I dream, I dream, I dream..



I saw the ocean envelop the sky

Put out the sun on the day that we died,

The former, the latter, and all in between,

They were vanquished by looking a fiend.



Do you remember me, do you remember me?

The one that you loved when he set you free.

Do you remember me, do you remember me?

The one with who you fell beneath the sea.



Yeah, we killed, we killed it all night.

All night.

Yeah, we killed, we killed it all night.

All night.

Yeah, we killed it, we killed it all night.

All night.

Yeah, we killed it, we killed it all night.

Cos im me to be what I shoose

I wanna be free to whisper the news

I don't really care about corporations

There must be some explanation for

What we have lost

But I stand for what I care about

Whatever the cost

Don't let yourself down, crash

Make those heads turn around

While someone is telling us how we should vote

The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing

Change a hawk to a little white dove

More than a feeling that's the power of love



Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream

Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream

Make a bad one good make a wrong one right

Power of love that keeps you home at night



You don't need money, don't take fame

Don't need no credit card to ride this train

It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes

But it might just save your life

That's the power of love

That's the power of love



First time you feel it, it might make you sad

Next time you feel it it might make you mad

But you'll be glad baby when you've found

That's the power makes the world go'round



And it don't take money, don't take fame

Don't need no credit card to ride this train

It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes

But it might just save your life



They say that all in love is fair

Yeah, but you don't care

But you know what to do

When it gets hold of you

And with a little help from above

You feel the power of love

You feel the power of love

Can you feel it ?

Hmmm



It don't take money and it don't take fame

Don't need no credit card to ride this train

Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel

You won't feel nothin' till you feel

You feel the power, just the power of love

That's the power, that's the power of love

You feel the power of love

You feel the power of love

Feel the power of love",Rock

Maybe you're the one who makes the winds blow

Maybe its not just down to you

oh god can we win back what we have lost

To who's the lost resort, Oh God



Tumbling towards unclear destinations

Do they wash away the flames the wind and the searing rains

As our powers interchange



Oh God can you tell us when its going to start

Maybe its not just down to you

Oh God can we win back what we have lost

To who's the lost resort, oh God



Oh God can you tell us when its going to stop

Maybe it's not just down to you

Oh God can we win back what we have lost

To who's the lost resort

"It started with a low light
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hopin'
That I could leave this star crossed world behind

When they cut me open

I guess I changed my mind



And you know I might

Have just flown too far from the floor this time

Cause they're calling me by my name

And they're zipping white light beams

Disregarding bombs and satellites



Oh that was the turning point,

That was one lonely night

The star maker says it ain't so bad

The dream maker's gonna make you mad

The spaceman says, Everybody look down

It's all in your mind



Well, now I'm back at home

And I'm looking forward to this life I live

You know it's gonna haunt me

So hesitation to this life I give

You think you might cross over

You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea

You better look it over

Before you make that leap



And you know I'm fine

But I hear those voices at night

Sometimes they justify my claim

And the public don't dwell on my transmission

Cause it wasn't televised

But it was the turning point

Oh what a lonely night

The star maker says it ain't so bad

The dream maker's gonna make you mad

The spaceman says, Everybody look down

It's all in your mind



The star maker says it ain't so bad

The dream maker's gonna make you mad

The spaceman says, Everybody look down

It's all in your mind



My global position systems are vocally addressed

They say the Nile used to run from East to West

They say the Nile used to run from East to West

I'm fine

But I hear those voices at night

Sometimes



The star maker says it ain't so bad

The dream maker's gonna make you mad

The spaceman says, Everybody look down

It's all in your mind



The star maker says it ain't so bad

The dream maker's gonna make you mad

"She's standind here like carved in stone
In silence veiled, her withered cheek
A childhood queen without a throne
My dreamless sleeping child
Red sorrow's grinning through my veins
My voice unheard, unseen the tears

I'm waiting where the moonsun reigns

My garden whispers tunes

Hear my voice and drink my tears

I await you with firetunes

Veiled in everlasting silence

But once your heart was full of tunes

As we danced as one with the dryads of July

Ashra

Autumnal storms of endless grey

The harvester will sorrow reap

You saw the spring, the spring in May

Mein Feuerlilienstern

Hear my voice...

Wenn Wesen, die die Sonne schuf

In Schlaf und Weltennacht versinken

Wenn ungehört verhallt mein Ruf

Will ich den Kelch des Todes trinken

I wove you a solar crown",Rock

In my last life
All good girls would go to heaven
But I've a strangeness
A queer propensity

For twisting the knife too easily



When I think I'm getting better

I'm just getting worse

When I think I've got it made

I am impossibly cursed



When did I become such a bitch

And how did I let this happen

I don't know

When did I become such a bitch

I used to be so ni-i-i-i-i-ice



It's like a sickness

I'm powerless to stop it

My boring life, my little heart

Made misanthropic

Don't give me reasons

Just give me therapy

(But really just give me what I want)



When I think I'm getting better

I'm evil again

When I think I've got it fixed

I hear familiar refrains



When did I become such a bitch

And how did I let this happen

I don't know

When did I become such a bitch

I used to be so nice

Well, I used to be alright



But I hate everyone and everything all of the time

And being so cruel

'Cause all the pleasure that I get

My wicked tongue helps me forget

Myself and all my foolish ways

'Cause being good is just so fucking boring

La la la, it's boring



When I think I'm getting better

I'm just getting worse

When I think I've got it made

I am impossibly cursed

When I think that I'm better

I'm worse, yes I am

When I think that I'm better

I find that I'm cursed



When did I become such a bitch

And how did I let this happen

I don't know

When did I become such a bitch

I used to be so nice once upon a time

Oh, when did I become such a bitch

And how did I let this happen

I don't know

"So our open wounds will bleed
Until our veins run dry
Now we have to take this thorn
And tear it from our side
Agitated at the fault line
Still agreed to disagree

Your connected to the heart

But tonight we'll set you free



So swallow the knife

Carve the way for your pride

Now our hands are tied

The problems lie within

So we pray for night

To start over again



Even now as i write this down

All pretensions disappear

Now our impulses will bite

At the ankles of our fear



So swallow the knife

Carve the way for your pride

Now our hands are tied

The problems lie within

So we pray for night

To start over again



Now our hands are tied

The problems lie within

So we pray for night

To start over again



Words are spoken

Words are broken down 



So lets make this night be our best mistake

So lets take the time to wipe the blood away

Now our hands are tied

And our world is caving in



Now our hands are tied

The problems lie within

So we pray for night

To start over again

And the problems lie within

J'aimerais seulement

Qu'ça marche

Sentir la peur

Avant qu'tu viennes



Danser avec ton ombre ( tout près )

M'ouvre les yeux

Et je retiens mon souffle

Ouais j'en tremble



Si j'avais ta confiance

Alors ce serait sans danger

Si seulement j'étais sûr

Ma tête sur ce mur

So sure, it will always last

Will the memories tase sweet as they linger

Or the bitterness stay on my tongue

Is my heart half full of the love you gave me

Or my heart half empty cuz your love is gone

The boxes are stacked on the lawn

You kiss me goodbye just like always

And you're gone

"Seems that we've lost our innocence
The pulpit the teachers
Have warned us
Blindly accepting
Their words as truth

And taking advantage of our trust



Don't expect an answer

Can't help that you're suspicious

Something is missing

So you can't decide

But you're letting them guide you



How can you listen

These empty words

In their messages meanings

Where's the beginning

If there's no end

Seems you're undecided



Fancy dress

Contrived rhetoric speech

The unlettered masses conforming

Rank and file members

Fearing change

But questioned their own faith

This morning



Don't expect an answer

Can't help that you're suspicious

Something is missing

Still you can't decide

But you're letting them guide you



How can we listen

These empty words

In their messages meanings

Where's the beginning

If there's no end

Seems we're undecided



And those that will listen

They see their world

In these messages meanings

But I can't accept this as proof

And it's always been a thrill

With booze and smoke from cigarettes and dope

This time no one pays

Betrayed by your own kind

Standing for one nation

Under a God who laughs

Criminally infested

Guilty, for all you have done

Does it break your heart each time I fall apart? 
Does it give you purpose in this life? 
And when I tell the truth 
Does it mean as much to you? 

I could never live a lie 

how 'bout you? 

And I don't think it's so wrong to feel 

I've lived too long 

Without the pull of gravity beneath me 

And it's not so hard to believe 

These tricks I use to deceive 

Like a rabbit from a hat or card up my sleeve 

Thought about being with you 

Thought how it's always been 

You takin' apart what I glued 

I know it's mine but it's crude I think you're so rude 

Follow the moon and the sun 

And all of the damage it's done 

I want to but I can't run 

I know it's only just begun 

It ain't no fun 

Thought about eyes of green 

And all of the shit that they've seen 

Never made it past seventeen 

Man what a scene 

You know what I mean? 

Thought of a skull and crossbones 

The poison it runs through our bones 

The junkies that live with their jones 

Always reaping what they've sown 

My mind is blown 

Thought of what's yours and what's mine 

And who all has got that much time 

Hey mister can you spare a dime? 

The words always rhyme 

The sun don't shine",Rock

Do we break another rule

Let our lovers play the fool

To stop feeling this way

And the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be free

Of your high school scene

Hungry eyes never seem to get their fill

Rosie, Rosie I wanna take you away 

Rosie, Rosie I'm gonna make you mine someday

You promised no one else would see

"Give us your tired, your weak
And we will make them strong
Bring us your far off song
And we will sing along
Leave us your broken dreams
We'll give them time to mend

There's still a lot of love

Living in the Promiseland



Living in the Promiseland

Our dreams are made of steels

The prayer of every one 

To know how freedom feels

There is a winding road 

Across shifting sand

And room for everyone

Living in the Promiseland



So they came with such a sad eye

Nameless woman, faceless child

Like a bad dream

Till there was no room at all

No place to place to run

And no place to fall



Give us your daily bread

We have no shoes to wear

No place to call our home

Only this cross to bear

We are the multitudes

Lend us a helping hand

Is there no love anymore 

Living in the Promiseland

The prayer of every man

Know how freedom feels

Across the shifting sand 

And room for everyone

her purse had just been stolen
she rad to make some cash

for fifty thousand pesos

my mothers box was his salt lick

human-donkey fornication

her taco is the destination



It soon became apparent

it wasn't for the dough

a genuine fiesta -

at the donkey show

the crowd would shout ""ole!""

as she nibbled on his sack

they never had a patron

demand their money back



A real freak show in the pit

the donkey's fucking my moms tits

acting like a true ranchero

dancing around a big sombrero



The donkey's name was Lucky

oh, boy, he loved to fuck

he'd get so damn excited

he'd kick and make you duck

if you want to be star

it's easy to be famous

just pull down your pants

let lucky fuck your anus

acting like a true ranchero

dancing around a big sombrero

And it gets harder every day for me

To hide behind this dream you see

A man I'll never be



I can't get any stronger

I can't climb any higher

You'll never know just how hard I've tried

Cry a little longer

And hold a little tighter

Emotions can't be satisfied



You look up at me

And somewhere in your mind you see

A man I'll never be



If only I could find a way

I'd feel like I'm the man you believe I am

And it gets harder every day for me

To hide behind this dream you see

A man I'll never be",Rock

And when they play The Wedding Samba

A hungry heart
To regulate their breathing

The Baltic moon

Along the northern seaboard

And down below

The Winter Boys are waiting for the storm

Shallow water - channel and tide



And I can trace my history

Down one generation to my home

In one of our submarines

One of our submarines



The red lights flicker, sonar weak

Air valves hissing open

Half her pressure blown away

Flounder in the ocean

See the Winter Boys

Drinking heavy water from a stone

Bye-bye empire, empire bye-bye

Tired illusion drown in the night

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options

Is the opposite of progress Congress?

From the school to the street we're beyond stress

but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is

war is big biz, ask an economist

speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous

Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up

Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!

I want black and brown unity

but cats get out to bring the jail to the community

Fightin's nothin' new to me

I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me

Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line:

We call it art, some call it a crime

it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine

on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1

Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned

the villain trained by the hero for the killing

now you twist $20 bills to see buildings

Under heavy surveillance

they might call you a traitor if you want something greater

Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live

just listen to the knowledge I give

if more than half the budget goes to military spending

less than half goes to whatever it's defending

One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties

and justice for all who are miserable

"We were both young, when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts-
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns.
I see you make your way through the crowd-

You say hello, little did I know...



That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles-

And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet""-

And I was crying on the staircase-

begging you, ""Please don't go...""

And I said...



Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.

I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,

It's a love story, baby, just say yes.



So I sneak out to the garden to see you.

We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew-

So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.

Oh, Oh.



Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter,

And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" -

but you were everything to me-

I was begging you, ""Please don't go""

And I said...



Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.

I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.

It's a love story, baby, just say yes-



Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.

This love is difficult, but it's real.

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.

It's a love story, baby, just say yes.

Oh, Oh.



I got tired of waiting.

Wondering if you were ever coming around.

My faith in you was fading-

When I met you on the outskirts of town.

And I said...



Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.

I keep waiting, for you but you never come.

Is this in my head, I don't know what to think-

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...



Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.

I love you, and that's all I really know.

I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress

It's a love story, baby just say... yes.

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

"[Intro:]
Yep
Follow me (Follow me)
Come with me to the dark side of the force (force)
No man would vote for your to this place
The devil only knows of this world

So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold, oh



[Chorus:]

Soon as my flow starts

I compose art like the ghost of Mozart

Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't

Boy you think you're clever don't ya girl you think your so smart

Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

(Stay wide awake) A world so cold, a world where on-ly some will go

(Stay wide awake) But not return, when will they learn?

Where do they go? God only knows

(Stay wide awake)



[Verse 1:]

3-5-4-4

I think I smell the scent of a placenta

I enter Central Park it's dark, it's winter in December

I see my target, whip my car in Park and approach her tender

Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her

Sit down beside her like a spider, Hi there girl you mighta

Heard of me before see whore you're the kinda girl that I'd a-

-ssault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy widea

Fuck you with an umbrella and then open it up while the shits inside ya

I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilda

Impregnate a lesbian, yea now let's see ya have triplets and I'll di-

-sintegrate them babies, as soon as they out hoe, with formalde-

-hyde in cyanide girl, you can try and hide, you can try to scream louda

No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun out of

Mur-derin I'd rather go 'vrinn-vrinn' and now you see just how the

Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalpa

Shit wait a minute, I mean skull my knife seems dull

Pull another one out uhhh



[Chorus]



[Verse 2:]

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me

There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-uns me

But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tum-my

It's makin me play hide-n-seek, like Jason I'm so hun-gry

She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me

So patient see I try to be but gee why does she taunt me?

Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep

And I creep right through the front seat

So blatently but silently cause I know that she's sound asleep

Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?

He's rapin me, she tries to scream, somebody please get him off me

He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughin likes it's funny

She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratching like some dumb freak

Escapin me, 'No Dice' you'll see, I might just be Ted Bundy

Or Satan gee, what a site to see, I'm dancing in my red panties

I'm crazy but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty

Stay away from me cause I'm dancin to quite a different drum beat



[Chorus]



[Verse 3:]

But I'd tried to stay wide awake

Cause you might be found dead by the lake

Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch's soul I'm a try to take

Pray for light today right away, why do they try to fight today?

I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away

Now I use power tools, how bout now while you in the shower?

Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets

How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya

Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there

I'll bet there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya

Face down in the tub, I drown you with piles of downers around ya

Such nostalgia and powers, such prowess, look how you cower

Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin Star Wars

Jabba the Hutt be de ba ba, be de ba ba it's time to da da

Ought to not even botha to scream, it don't even matta

Amazing when raising skin with these razor blades he waves at ya

Not your everyday game, he invade me in holy water

Nothin like somethin to say, so please understand there's no gun-in-hand

Where's the thrill in a hunt? there's no fun in that, here I come with axe

Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin him up with that

What was that? dial 911 someone's comin in from the back

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert

Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp

That right there could drive a sane man berserk

Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to work

How do you console my mom or give her light support

Tellin' her her son's on life support?

And just imagine how my girl feel

On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till

She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine

She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign

No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed

Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines

In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died

The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man

Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band

I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man



Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall

- I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man -

For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all

- They got my mouth wired shut for like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks -

Through the fire, through whatever, come what may

- Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw, I looked in the mirror

And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it -

For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way

- But I'm still here for y'all right now, man -

Right down to the wire, even through the fire

- This what I got to say right here, dawg, yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh -



What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal

On the hottest rap label around?

But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds

It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?

And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory

And what we need to do in the game

Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time

In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed

If you could feel how my face felt

You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)

Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt

I swear to God, driver two wanna sue

I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe

My dawgs couldn't tell if I…

I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised

There's been an accident like GEICO

They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael

I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass

Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?

Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past

Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash

And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid

Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did

But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph

Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire



Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall

- Y'know what I'm sayin'? When the doctor told me I had, um -

For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all

- That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said -

Through the fire, through whatever, come what may

- ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"" -

For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way

- ""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""

Is he the doctor's man to take me away?
Or the same damn demon from yesterday?
Waking up is virtually impossible
Something in this story won't let me go

You know I'm shaking and I'm feeling sick

Guess I'm gonna need a vodka quick



Momma's lace and whiskey on the top shelf

Somehow they got caught up in my dream

Monsters on my right and cobwebs on my left

Scary man standin' right in front of me



Hey man, I think I like being scared

An' I wish you all were here



Tomorrow, if I get my strength

I'll put my Daddy's gun to use

I hate it, I hate it, feels like I'm drowning

The man's tied me up and I think he's frowning



Black widow is his favorite bite

Why does the creature cling so tight?

Makes her crawl on my face and neck

God, the man drives me a nervous wreck



Why am I starting to like this?

You know he hasn't hurt me yet

But it's different now, just a whim

Maybe I'm becoming his pet

"It's so hard to be without you
Lying in the bed you are so much to be without
Rattles in my head that empty drum filled with doubt
Everything you lose will always come find its way out
Every night is lonesome

And is longer than before

And nothing really matters anymore



It's so hard to be without you

You used to for saying how only I feel hungry

Stinging from the storm inside my ribs where it thunders

Nothing left to say or even really wonder



We're like a book

Every page is so torn

Nothing really matters anymore



It's so hard not to call you

Thunders in my bones

Out on the streets

Where I first saw you



Everything was new and colorful

It's gotten darker

Every day is a lesson things went right before

And nothing really matters anymore



It's so hard to be without you

Everyday I find another little thread of silver

Waiting for me when I wake some place on the pillow

And then I see the empty space beside me and remember

I feel empty

I feel tired

I feel worn

Nothing really matters anymore",Rock

Test, check. Well, he's been released today, and I'm going back where I started.

this time. The wounds seem to be healing, and he seems to be getting along. But as I
appendage it, and I know he seems fine, But seems can be a very dangerous word,
especially in this business, it can be fatal.



Initial Diagnosis: Catatonic. and I know he's back there somewhere, but there's just

no response whatsoever, to any kind of set illness. We'll start him with medication

tomorrow, for sure.



This mans tragedy has made him a prisoner in his own body. And it's not just tragedy,

it's dementia, despair, its this hole i can see in each of his eyes. Where all the

events that happen in this cruel world just kind of fall through. It's loneliness in

it's most crippling form. The kind that no amount of love, or human contact, could ever

mend.



The patient was plagued by violent nightmares. Terrible, deeply troubling dreams.

Which one night overflowed in to reality, and he murdered his wife, in his sleep.

These people were in love, deeply in love. And it's that love that I can now see

behind his eyes. And it's my job to try and fill those holes with something else.

But what? Hope. I can try to fill those holes with drugs, soothing words, but

that's all. I hope those wounds will heal in time, but right now, things aren't

looking good.

So many times I'm almost in tune

Watching them flying in formation

Thinking how I could be so immune



I've seen them I've been there with them

I can tell you all you want to know

Something touched me and I was only sleeping

Wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to go



Stars climbing into their planets

Systems won, controlled from birth

Empty living on this highway

Can you see me mother earth



It's so endless whirling onwards

Wonder what's cooking at home tonight

Maybe if I promise not to say a word

They can get me back before the morning light",Rock

The way you cut and paste and twist

Tell him everything

Tell him you know how I feel

Tell him you know how i feel

At the palace gates

When I'm all levered of my face

And I can work out what it's not about

And see snakes in eyes

And a million danger signs



If you were late you mustn't dare complain

And you wont like this at all

There's nothing to break your fall



And you know how I feel out of place

Until I've levered up my face

And I can work out what you're going on about

Let me explain, you have to play the game

His heart is in the lonely way

Death contagious deity



Hooked into this deceiver

Need more and more

Into the endless fever

Burn through all your gasoline

Asylum overtime

Choke the clock

Steal another day



Die

Narcissistic fade away

Jump the rail

Shout at the crowd below

Chase the ghost

The latest high to all time low



Hooked into this deceiver

Drop the hourglass of time

Spinning sand we will not find

As we gather here today

We bid farewell



The slave becomes the master

Right now and ever after

Dead hourglass of time

Sand we will not ever find

We gather here today

Say goodbye

'Cause you've reached the end of the line



The end of the line

The end of the line

The end of the line

You've reached the end of the line

"Lover
There is no other
Someday you will discover
That we could not lose
We'd break all the rules

Lover

Why do I suffer

I don't wanna be

Your mother

I have no shame

Love's not a fair game



(Chorus)

Where are the hours

Nearing the end

One superpower

Superhuman

How could you never

Want to feel this way again

Remember when



Lover

Leave while I'm sober

This moment will pass us over

You have become wise

Much to your surprise



(Chorus)

Where to begin

My long lost friend

Let's start again

Tomorrow



Lover

This is no fable

Together we might be able

Love if you like

You know that I'm right



(Chorus)



Lover",Pop
"(Michael McDonald)
Who would sell their soul for love?
Or waste one tear on compromise
Should be easy enough
To know a heartache in disguise

But the heart rules the mind

And the going gets rough

Pride takes the fall

When you find that kind of love



I can't help feeling like a fool

Since I lost that place inside

Where my heart knew its way

And my soul was ever wise

Once innocence was lost

There was not faith enough

Still my heart held on

When it found that kind of love



Though beauty is rare enough

Still we trust

Somehow we'll find it there

With no guarantee

It seems to me

At least it should be fair



But if it's only tears and pain

Isn't it still worth the cost

Like some sweet saving grace

Or a river we must cross

If we don't understand

What this life is made of

We learn the truth

When we find that kind of love

Cause when innocence is lost

There is not faith enough

We learn the truth

When we find that kind of love",Country

"Once we get to the end of this song,
then it wil begin again.
So you said,
in our bed.
I was watching light ship

through blinds to find your skin.



So take your medicine

and I won't ask where you've been.

Live your lost weekend.

I know you've wanted it.

Get big, little kid.



And I can't say why each day

doesn't quite fit the space

we saved for it.

But if that space now demands

that you throw up both your hands,

that you call it quits...



Take your midnight trip

I know you've dreamed of it.

Walk your sunset strip,

because I think you've needed it 

to get big, little kid.



But just remember that our love

only got this good

because of those younger days

that'd you like to outstrip.

So drink your cup down 

to the dregs and leave

that club shaking legs

with another guy,

but just remember: I'm not him.



Take your medicine and I won't ask

where you've been.

Live your lost weekend,

because I know you've wanted it

to get big, little kid.



And once we get to the end of this song,

then another will begin.",Rock

"[Talking: Nas]
Yo... it's like waking up from a bad dream
Just to figure out you weren't dreaming in the first place
[Verse 1:]
If all I saw was gangsters

Coming up as a youngster

Pussy and money the only language I clung ta

Claim ta, unrolled myself up to become one

Ain't ya happy I chose rap

I'm amongst tha

Streets deceiving

Can't believe my achievements

Cultural strata

Persona's that of a non-needer

Because I don't need nada except for Prada beaver

For cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless

To my g's on the flee from the coppers

Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors

From the slums I come up a phoenix

Caked up, tryna take what I'm eating

Came up a dismissive kid

You lucky if you allowed to witness this

Savvy mouth

Wild, hardly

A man's man

Who woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties

Jezebel's and Stella McCartney's

For years, all that

How could I not be dead

This old German

Said I was a thug with a notty head

Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled

With a face like he wonder where I got my bread

Probably all these stones he see

From my shows overseas

From crime to rhyme

My stories is I'm from the home of the thieves



[Verse 2:]

Blessed

The lord is a g, he gotta be

Who's the God of suckers and snitches

The economy

Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe

Blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro

He'd want me to spit this

Only the strong survive

Nas bear witness

The hypocrisy is all I can see

White cop acquitted for murder

Black cop cop a plea

That type of shit make me stop and think

We in chronic need of a second look of the law books

And the whole race dichotomy

Too many rappers, athletes, and actors

But not enough niggas in NASA

Who give you the latest dances, trends, and fashion

But when it comes to residuals, they look past us

Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us

Even in white tee's, blue jeans, and red bandanas



[Verse 3:]

Assassinations

Diplomatic relations

Killed indigenous people

Built a new nation

Involuntary labor

Took a knife split a woman naval

Took her premature baby

Let her man see you rape her

If I could travel to the 1700's

I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite

Through your covenant

Love to sit in on the Senate

And tell the whole government

Y'all don't treat women fair

She read about herself in the bible

Believing she the reason sin is here

You played her, with an apron

Like bring me my dinner, dear

She the nigger here

Ain't we in the free world

Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls

Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casually

Bugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me

How far we really from third world savagery

When the empire fall, imagine how crazy that'll be",Rap
